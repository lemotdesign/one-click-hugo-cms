      If you're hearing scratching sounds in your roof or walls, or if you've
      spotted a rat scurrying along your fence, it's possible you have a rodent
      issue.

      Rodents, such as rats and mice, have lived alongside humans throughout history. They often seek shelter in our homes and can be quite destructive, not only damaging structures and food supplies but also posing health risks. They are known carriers of diseases and fleas. It's important to address any rodent problem in your home promptly to protect your health and property.

      Ever stepped outside and felt a sharp sting, then noticed tiny critters
      hopping on your legs? Or walked into a room that's been closed for a while
      and found yourself in a flea circus? 


      #### Flea Treatment


      No worries, our team's got you covered! We use a safe, non-toxic spray with this special thing called IGR (Insect Growth Regulator). It messes up the flea babies' growth, and zaps most adults on contact.


      Don't forget, it's super important to spray outside too – that's where your furry friends might pick up fleas from those wild neighborhood cats.


      **Heads up**: Flea eggs are tough little nuggets, immune to chemicals, and they only hatch when they feel the vibes – like when you walk by. So, if you've got a real flea party going on, we usually suggest hitting them with **two rounds** of treatment to really get the job done.

      Got lawn grubs munching on your grass? In South East Queensland, these
      pesky critters are a usual headache from November to May, especially for
      couch lawns (though 'Sir Walter' lawns tend to fare better). 


      The good news? They're pretty easy to treat if you catch them early. Prevention and early detection are key. Also, keep an eye out during heavy rain periods, as that's when lawn grub issues usually ramp up.
