      If you're hearing scratching sounds in your roof or walls, or if you've
      spotted a rat scurrying along your fence, it's possible you have a rodent
      issue.

      Rodents, such as rats and mice, have lived alongside humans throughout history. They often seek shelter in our homes and can be quite destructive, not only damaging structures and food supplies but also posing health risks. They are known carriers of diseases and fleas. It's important to address any rodent problem in your home promptly to protect your health and property.
