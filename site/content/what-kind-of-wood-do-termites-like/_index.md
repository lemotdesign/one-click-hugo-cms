      Termites, often dubbed the "silent destroyers," have a knack for making
      themselves known only after they've caused significant damage. But how do
      these tiny critters seemingly pop up out of nowhere?


      ## Should I panic about termites?


      Have you just found evidence of termites in your home and wondered how they came in? You hadn’t seen any signs of termites, mud leads, or termite trails, but suddenly they appear in your home!


      Termites are **constantly** foraging around your house in subterranean tunnels that are usually only a foot under the ground. First, they might seek moisture in your home, like a leaky shower tray or dripping tap. But the main prize is all the edible timber in your house. Mean to say, termites regard your home as ‘one large tree’.

      ### There is a bonanza of timber in your home for the Termites to eat


      Indeed, your home is like a treasure trove of timber for termites. With the average Australian home containing about 14.58 cubic meters of wood, it presents a vast resource for these wood-eating insects. 


      ### How much wood do Termites eat?


      Termite workers eat about 5% of their body weight in wood daily. While this might seem small, it adds up quickly in a large colony with around a million workers. In such cases, a nest targeting your home can devour around 100 grams+ of wood each day.

      Termites will eat all types of timber, but they are super clever in
      sourcing the wood with the most desirable nutrients and cellulose. It’s
      all about efficient foraging and a balanced diet for the colony.


      A big mistake Australian homeowners make is thinking their home is constructed with hardwood, when in fact, it is just plantation eucalyptus (gum trees). Yes, it is considerably harder than radiata pine, but it is highly desirable timber for termites to eat.


      Eucalyptus timbers are the most effective wood to use in bait stations to attract termites. Not saying your home is a big bait station, but it is the ultimate feeding Buffett for termites.

      Don't wait until you see evidence of termites - Act now and get your home
      inspected


      Termites don't appear out of nowhere; they've usually been around for longer than you realize. 


      Regular home inspections and being aware of the subtle signs of their presence can help in early detection, preventing extensive damage to your home. 


      Remember, it's always easier to tackle a termite problem in its early stages than after they've firmly established themselves.
