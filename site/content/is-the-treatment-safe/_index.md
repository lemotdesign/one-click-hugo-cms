      At Conquer Termites, we truly get the worries Gold Coast homeowners face
      when considering pest control for their homes. Our priority? Bidding bugs
      goodbye without compromising your family's well-being.


      ### Children or pets, is it safe for them?


      Got kiddos or furry friends? No worries! We always adjust our methods based on your home's unique needs, to only apply the safest product available in Australia.


      We will be applying a mix of treatments like gel bait, dust, and surface sprays. All products we apply meet the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority guidelines. Safety first, always!


      Before we dive into the nitty-gritty of our general pest control, we wanted to give you a heads-up on what to expect and how to prepare. 


      ### How long does it take?


      ### Do I need to stay away?


      ### How long will the treatment last?




      ### General Information about our Pest Control Treatment:


      1. The idea of ‘Pest Control’ is about reducing the pesty pests’ population to near zero. It is not about applying a nasty product to keep all insects away for 12 months. Insects will recolonise your home naturally over time.

      2. There is a residual action with the treatment, so it might take several weeks to be fully effective. In the case where the pest population or conditions are severe, we might recommend more frequent treatments.\


      ### How a Pest Control is done at your home:

      ## What to do before we come:


      1. Vacuum along the skirting boards and wet clean all hard floors (tiles, timber floors and laminate planks). The reason is that we don’t want you to ‘wet wipe’ the edges of the hard floors for at least four weeks where we have sprayed our product. 
         The longer you can leave it there, the better it will work. You can vacuum or sweep.  
      2. Remove sensitive items like kids’ toys from the floor. and move items away from the walls. This way, we will be able to achieve the maximum application throughout your home. 

      3. You don’t need to empty cupboards or move heavy furniture as we will be applying gel bait in these areas.

      4. Our technician will always do a pre-service check, we are happy to move pet bowls, dog beds etc. But bird cages or fish tanks should be covered before we start.

      5. Remove clothes from the line.

      6. If you are planning to get your house washed or carpet cleaned, do it before we come. 

      7. Don’t remove spiderwebs before we come. We need the spiders to climb over their webs for the product to work.

      8. To reduce black ants, keep gardens away from the external walls and cut back any tree branches that are touching the house.
