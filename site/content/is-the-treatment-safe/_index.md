      At Conquer Termites, we truly get the worries Gold Coast homeowners face
      when considering pest control for their homes. Our priority? Bidding bugs
      goodbye without compromising your family's well-being.


      ### Children or pets, is it safe for them?


      Got kiddos or furry friends? No worries! We always adjust our methods based on your home's unique needs, to only apply the safest product available in Australia.


      We will be applying a mix of treatments like gel bait, dust, and surface sprays. All products we apply meet the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority guidelines. Safety first, always!


      Before we dive into the nitty-gritty of our general pest control, we wanted to give you a heads-up on what to expect and how to prepare. 


      We will send you a "**What to do before your Pest Control treatment**' information email and issue a '**Post Treatment Advice**' so you know exactly what products were applied.
