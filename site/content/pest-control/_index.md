  - heading: Is there a warranty for pest control treatment?
    text: >-
      Yes, we do offer a pest treatment warranty, mean to say, we want you to be
      happy and satisfied. But we don’t want to be the company that overpromises
      and underdelivers!


      ### **Pest control warranties**


      **Cockroaches - 12 months**


      **Silverfish - 3 months**


      **Black ants - 3 months**


      **Fleas - nil** (Needs to be treated until the infestation is under control).


      **Spiders - 3 months**


      **Rodents - nil** (Needs to be replenished until the infestation is under control).


      Proper pest control treatment is about eradicating pests and bringing the population down to zero. It is not designed to keep pests away for 12 months.\

      \

      How long it takes for new insects to recolonise your home depends on the surroundings and environment. It might take many months before spiders, and black ants recolonise, or they could come back sooner.

      When it comes to pest control, your safety and comfort are paramount. We
      arrange our treatment process to minimize disruption and maximize
      protection for you, your family, and your pets.


      **Here's what we recommend during treatment:**


      * **While Spraying Indoors:** We advise you to step outside. This allows the treatment to settle and minimizes exposure to the application process.

      * **While Treating Outdoors:** Conversely, it's best to remain indoors. This helps prevent any direct contact with the treatments and ensures the application is undisturbed.

      * **Post-Treatment:** We ask that you avoid the treated areas until they are completely dry. This drying period is crucial for the effectiveness of the treatment and your safety.


      **We will send you information for the best outcome**


      We will email you a "Pest Advice Notice" before the treatment so you know what to do before we come and what to do after the treatment

      At Conquer, we stand by the belief that quality takes precedence over haste. 


      Effective pest control is not just a matter of treatment but also about understanding and addressing your specific concerns. That's why we dedicate a generous amount of time for your pest treatment:

      * **Average-Sized Homes:** We spend over 1 & 1/2 hours treating standard homes, covering all necessary aspects.

      * **Smaller Homes or Apartments:** A full hour is dedicated even to the smallest properties, ensuring Conquer's high standards are met.


      Our meticulous approach ensures that your pest control treatment is thorough, effective, and tailored to your home's specific needs.
