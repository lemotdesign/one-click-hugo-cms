  - heading: Is there a warranty for pest control treatment?
    text: >-
      Yes, we do offer a pest treatment warranty, mean to say, we want you to be
      happy and satisfied. But we don’t want to be the company that overpromises
      and underdelivers!


      ![Conquer Termites Pest Control warranties](img/conquer-termites-pest-control-warranties.jpg)


      ### **Pest control warranties**


      **Cockroaches - 12 months**


      **Silverfish - 3 months**


      **Black ants - 3 months**


      **Fleas - nil**\

      Needs to be treated until the infestation is under control.


      **Spiders - 3 months**


      **Rodents - nil**\

      Needs to be replenished until the infestation is under control.


      Proper pest control treatment is about eradicating pests and bringing the population down to zero. It is not designed to keep pests away for 12 months.\

      \

      How long it takes for new insects to recolonise your home depends on the surroundings and environment. It might take many months before spiders, and black ants recolonise, or they could come back sooner.

  - heading: Will the treatment be safe for my family and pests?
    text: >-
      This is an understandable question; Sadly, our industry has its’ fair
      share of cowboys that do shoddy and cheap work, using inappropriate
      chemicals.


      ### Conquer only uses the safest and most proven products


      For over 20 years, Conquer has carefully selected and tested the safest and most\

      effective products to apply to your home.\

      \

      To reassure you:


      * We only use clear odourless Pyrethrin (based on a daisy extract) sprays inside your house

      * We don’t spray inside your kitchen cupboards but apply gel bait.\

      *  The spray we apply outside to control spiders and black ants has the same active ingredient used in Frontline for flea and tick control for your dogs and cats.

  - heading: Do I need to leave during the Pest Treatment?
    text: >-
      No, there is no need for you to leave the house while we are applying the
      pest control treatment.\

      \

      We will ask you to vacate the room we are spraying inside and to be careful not to slip on the spray along the edges of the hard floors until it has dried.\

      \

      When we spray the outside, we will ask you to bring your pets in and temporarily close the windows.\

      \

      But if you want to pop out for a walk or coffee, we understand.

  - heading: How long does a Pest Control Treatment take?
    text: >-
      At Conquer, we prioritize thoroughness over speed when it comes to pest
      control treatment. We allocate a minimum of 2 hours to each pest
      treatment, and often more, to ensure that the job is done properly.\

      \

      With our pre-check, we typically start with a chat to find out your main concerns so we can address them before doing a walk-around check.


      From there, we will usually treat the inside, applying the gel bait and spraying the skirting broads. We also apply a dusting treatment through the access point into your roof.\

      \

      To finish, we target spray the outside.\

      **Big home: 1 & 1/2 hours**\

      **Average size home: 1+ hour**\

      **Smaller homes or apartment: 1 hour**
