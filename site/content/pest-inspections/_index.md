      ## Buying a Home? Watch Out for Those Termites!


      When you're splashing out on a new home, the last thing you want is a dud or a termite party house. That's why getting an Expert to do a **Timber Pest Inspection** is key. These aren't your average quick checks; they follow the Aussie Standard 4349.3.2010 and look at:


      * Termite infestation, Fungal decay (wet rot) and Borer infestation.


      This isn't just a peek-around. It's a deep dive into the timber's health in your potential home, pointing out any creepy crawlies or issues that could mess with the building's strength.

      ## How much does a Termite (White Ant) inspection cost?


      Suspect you've discovered termites? Now you're wondering, how bad is the damage and how deep will I need to dig into my pockets? 


      ‘What is the price’ is an obvious question. You know very little about termites and probably have never engaged a pest control company specialising in treating termites.


      On the Gold Coast, for an average-sized house a termite inspection costs between **$280 and $330.**

      To deliver the best termite inspection on the Gold Coast, it is essential
      to have and use advanced detection tools such as a thermal camera, a
      Termatrac motion detection device, and a moisture meter. 


      When the individual operating these devices is truly proficient in their use and understands the specifics of what to search for, you can expect to receive a comprehensive analysis of your home's termite condition.


      *Make sure to verify when booking a company on the Gold Coast; not all of them may have or utilize these devices!*

      Make sure to get your home checked for termites at least **once a year**,
      following the Australian Standards 3660.2.


      **Consider more often**

      If your house is older, built a certain way, or close to woods, you might need more frequent inspections.


      **Current chemical treatment?**

      Without a chemical barrier around your home, termites can sneak in easily. Regular inspections are key for early detection and prevention, just like regular dental check-ups, especially if you don't have any termite treatment.

      To help you, we would like to give you a checklist of questions you should
      ask when calling Pest Control companies on the  Gold Coast. 


      1. Is the company genuinely local to the Gold Coast? (Avoid call centres from Sydney or Melbourne).

      2. What's their business tenure and team size?

      3. How do their Google Reviews fare?

      4. Do they hold a Queensland Health Timber Pest **license**?

      5. Are they licensed under the [QBCC](https://www.qbcc.qld.gov.au/node/2526) (Queensland Building Construction Commission)?

    text: >-
      #### **Watch Out for Fake Companies**


      Beware of pest control websites that look local but actually run their call center from another city and lack the right Queensland licenses. Remember, every legit company in Queensland needs a QBCC license to operate. No license? That means no insurance and they shouldn't be offering termite inspections or treatments.


      #### **Be Wary of Free Checks**


      Watch out for companies offering a **free** "termite check" and then pushing some expensive and sketchy baiting system. These guys usually aren't licensed or qualified, and you might even be asked to sign a waiver acknowledging it's just a check, not a proper inspection to Australian Standards.
