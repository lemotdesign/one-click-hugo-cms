      ## How much does a Termite (White Ant) inspection cost? 


      Suspect you've discovered termites? Now you're wondering, how bad is the damage and how deep will I need to dig into my pockets? 


      ‘What is the price’ is an obvious question. You know very little about termites and probably have never engaged a pest control company specialising in treating termites.


      On the Gold Coast, for an average-sized house a termite inspection costs between **$280 and $330.**


      But you must compare apples with apples when selecting a company for your termite inspection. Sadly, our industry significantly differs in quality, knowledge, and approach.

      #### **Australia's Pioneering Digital Inspection Reports**


      We led the way in Australia by introducing digital inspection reports that incorporate photographic evidence, enhancing the clarity and detail of our feedback. Our ongoing improvements to our reports and recommendations are designed to empower you with the knowledge to make the best decisions for your property.


      #### **Surpassing Australian Standards 3660.2**

We pride ourselves on conducting detailed evaluations of your property and gardens, not just meeting but exceeding the required standards. Our thorough 22-page digital report, complete with illustrative photos, ensures you have a clear and complete understanding of the inspection findings.

      Ensure your home is safeguarded against termites by scheduling a
      professional inspection at least **once every year**, as per the
      Australian Standards 3660.2 guidelines. 


      **Maybe more frequently**


      Given that certain factors such as the structure's age, construction type, and proximity to woodlands may elevate the risk of termite infestation, more regular check-ups might be necessary for some properties.


      **Do you have a current chemical treatment?**


      Lacking a continuous chemical barrier around your home's perimeter can leave it very vulnerable to undetected termite invasions. That's why, similar to how you wouldn't skip your annual dental check-up, keeping up with termite inspections is crucial for early detection and prevention - especially if you don't have a treatment!

      To help you, we would like to give you a checklist of questions you should
      ask when calling companies on the Gold Coast. 


      #### You don’t need to ask them all - choose your best three:


      1. Is the company genuinely local to the Gold Coast? (Avoid call centres from Sydney or Melbourne).

      2. What's their business tenure and team size?

      3. How do their Google Reviews fare?

      4. Do they hold a Queensland Health Timber Pest **license**?

      5. Are they licensed under the [QBCC](https://www.qbcc.qld.gov.au/node/2526) (Queensland Building Construction Commission)?


      #### Additional points to consider


      * Is the company **insured**, and to what extent?

      * Do all technicians utilize **[Thermal Cameras and Termatrac](https://www.conquertermites.com.au/inspections/termite-inspections/detection-devices/)** Motion Detection tools?

      * Does the inspection cover getting into the roof and the subfloor areas?

      * What's the duration of a typical termite inspection?

      * Will I receive a **digital report** on the same day?

      * Can they offer a **treatment proposal** and execute it?

      * Do they possess **accreditations** from the chemical manufacturers they use?

      #### **Fake companies - no QBCC license**


      Many pest control companies construct a website to make them look local but have their call centre in another city and don’t have the appropriate Queensland licenses.

      (photo of QBCC cards)


      All companies operating in Queensland need to have a QBCC license. Otherwise, you are engaging a subcontractor. If they don’t have a QBCC license, they can’t get insurance and shouldn’t be advertising that they do termite inspections and treatments.


      #### **Free check offers - not licensed**


      Some companies offer a free “termite check” and quickly suggest a dodgy, overpriced wooden box baiting system. These guys aren’t licensed or qualified. Often you need to sign a waiver to say you are accepting a ‘check’, not an inspection to the Australian Standards.
