      5. Are they licensed under the [QBCC](https://www.qbcc.qld.gov.au/node/2526) (Queensland Building Construction Commission)?


      #### Additional points to consider

      * Do all technicians utilize **[Thermal Cameras and Termatrac](https://www.conquertermites.com.au/inspections/termite-inspections/detection-devices/)** Motion Detection tools?

      Ensure your home is safeguarded against termites by scheduling a
      professional inspection at least **once every year**, as per the
      Australian Standards 3660.2 guidelines. 


      **Maybe more frequently**


      Given that certain factors such as the structure's age, construction type, and proximity to woodlands may elevate the risk of termite infestation, more regular check-ups might be necessary for some properties.


      **Do you have a current chemical treatment?**


      Lacking a continuous chemical barrier around your home's perimeter can leave it very vulnerable to undetected termite invasions. That's why, similar to how you wouldn't skip your annual dental check-up, keeping up with termite inspections is crucial for early detection and prevention - especially if you don't have a treatment!

      Purchasing a home is a significant investment, and the last thing you want
      is to end up with a lemon or a termite-infested property. That's why it's
      crucial to schedule the right kind of inspection with a qualified and
      experienced inspector who can conduct a **Timber Pest Inspection**
      according to the Australian Standard 4349.3.2010.


      Unlike a regular visual termite inspection, a Timber Pest Inspection covers:


      * Termite infestation  

      * Fungal decay (wet rot)

      * Borer infestation.


      This thorough inspection will give you a comprehensive understanding of the condition of the property's timber and identify any pest-related issues that may affect the structural integrity of the building.

      ## How much does a termite (white ant) inspection cost on the Gold Coast?


      Suspect you've discovered termites? Now you're wondering, how bad is the damage and how deep will I need to dig into my pockets? 


      ‘What is the price’ is an obvious question. You know very little about termites and probably have never engaged a pest control company specialising in treating termites.


      On the Gold Coast, the average termite inspection cost for an average-sized house is between **$280 and $330.**


      But you must compare apples with apples when selecting a company for your termite inspection. Sadly, our industry significantly differs in quality, knowledge, and approach.


      ##### This should include the following:


      •	Using devices - Thermal camera, Moisture meter and Termatrac motion detection

      •	Inspect the fenceline, garden, house perimeter, subfloor, internal exposed timbers and roof void

      •	Digital report completed on the day, plus a treatment proposal

      •	It should take up to two hours

      #### **Fake companies - no QBCC license**


      Many pest control companies construct a website to make them look local but have their call centre in another city and don’t have the appropriate Queensland licenses.

      (photo of QBCC cards)


      All companies operating in Queensland need to have a QBCC license. Otherwise, you are engaging a subcontractor. If they don’t have a QBCC license, they can’t get insurance and shouldn’t be advertising that they do termite inspections and treatments.


      #### **Free check offers - not licensed**


      Some companies offer a free “termite check” and quickly suggest a dodgy, overpriced wooden box baiting system. These guys aren’t licensed or qualified. Often you need to sign a waiver to say you are accepting a ‘check’, not an inspection to the Australian Standards.
