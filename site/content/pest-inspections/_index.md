      Five points to consider when choosing a Gold Coast Termite Company


      To help you, we would like to give you a checklist of questions you should ask when calling companies on the Gold Coast. You don’t need to ask them all - choose your best three:


      1. Are they local and based in Brisbane (beware of calling a call centre in Sydney or Melbourne)

      2. How long have they been in business, and do they have a good-size crew?

      3. How are their Google Reviews?

      4. Do they have a Queensland Health Timber Pest license?

      5. Do they have a QBCC (Queensland Building Construction Commission) license?
         Additional points to consider
         •	Does the inspection have the right kind of insurance, and how much does it cover?
         •	Do all the technicians carry and use Thermal Cameras, Moisture Meters and Motion Detection devices?
         •	Do they inspect the roof void and all the subfloor (space under the floor)?
         •	How many hours do they assign to do a termite inspection?
         •	Do you get a digital report on the day?
         •	Can they supply a treatment proposal and do the work?
         •	Are they accredited through the chemical company to apply the product?

      ### How much does a termite (white ant) inspection cost on the Gold Coast?


      ‘What is the price’ is an obvious question. You know very little about termites and probably have never engaged a pest control company specialising in treating termites.

      But you must compare apples with apples when selecting a company for your termite inspection. Sadly, our industry significantly differs in quality, knowledge, and approach.

      On the Gold Coast, the average termite inspection cost for an average-sized house is between $280 and $330.


      ##### This should include the following:


      •	Using devices - Thermal camera, Moisture meter and Termatrac motion detection

      •	Inspect the fenceline, garden, house perimeter, subfloor, internal exposed timbers and roof void

      •	Digital report completed on the day, plus a treatment proposal (and they should be able to do the work)

      •	It should take one to two hours


      ### How often should I get a termite Inspection done?


      The Australian Standards 3660.2 recommend that homeowners have a qualified pest control technician inspect their property for termites every 12 months. This is the minimum requirement; some houses might need more frequent inspections due to construction, age and high termite pressure (near bushland).

      If you don’t have a termite barrier (external chemical treatment) continuously around the external perimeter of your home, termites can gain concealed entry or enter by mud leads at any time. This is why you might be told to get your home inspected more frequently.

      Think of an annual termite inspection like your yearly dentist appointment. It’s not fun, but it is vital to be proactive before a small problem becomes significant and painful!


      ### Pre-purchase Termite Inspection – Timber Pest Inspection


      Purchasing a home is a significant investment, and the last thing you want is to end up with a lemon or a termite-infested property. That's why it's crucial to schedule the right kind of inspection with a qualified and experienced inspector who can conduct a Timber Pest Inspection to the Australian Standard 4349.3.2010.

      Unlike a regular visual termite inspection, a Timber Pest Inspection covers termite infestation, fungal decay (wet rot), and borer infestation. 

      This thorough inspection will give you a comprehensive understanding of the condition of the property's timber and identify any pest-related issues that may affect the structural integrity of the building.

      At Conquer Termites, our expert inspectors will provide you with a detailed report and a treatment proposal that offers advice on treatments and costs. With our pre-purchase termite inspection service, you can make an informed decision about your potential property investment and ensure your peace of mind.


      ### Consumer Warning about termite inspections on the Gold Coast


      **Fake companies - no QBCC license**

      Many pest control companies construct a website to make them look local but have their call centre in another city and don’t have the appropriate Queensland licenses.

      (photo of QBCC cards)

      All companies operating in Queensland need to have a QBCC license. Otherwise, you are engaging a subcontractor. If they don’t have a QBCC license, they can’t get insurance and shouldn’t be advertising that they do termite inspections and treatments.

      **Free check offers - not licensed**

      Some companies offer a free “termite check” and quickly suggest a dodgy, overpriced wooden box baiting system. These guys aren’t licensed or qualified. Often you need to sign a waiver to say you are accepting a ‘check’, not an inspection to the Australian Standards.
