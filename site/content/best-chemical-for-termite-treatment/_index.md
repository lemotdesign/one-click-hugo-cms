      The most effective termite treatment is one that stops termites, right?
      But knowing there are **no** absolutes when protecting a house and that
      treatments can fail, it's crucial to weigh all the factors before you
      decide on a company to handle your termite situation.\n


      #### The Five Vital Considerations When Choosing Termite Treatment


      1. **Effectiveness**: It must halt termite activity.

      2. **Safety**: It should be safe for you and the environment.

      3. **Durability**: Consider how long the treatment will last.

      4. **Cost**: Keep in mind that cheaper will not be better.

      5. **Workmanship:** Will the treatment company leave your home in a tidy condition? \n


      ### Types of Termite Management Systems


      1. **Chemical Treatment** (some companies call this a termite barrier)

      2. **Baiting Systems**

      3. **Physical** (Installed during construction)\n\n 


      ### Horses for Courses - a tailored approach


      The choice between chemical and non-chemical termite management should be tailored to **your** home's construction and unique circumstances.

      Our preferred go-to chemical is **Termidor HE**, manufactured by BASF.


      Termidor stands out as a non-repellent transfer product with a remarkable lifespan of up to **eight** years. The ingenious concept lies in termites' inability to detect Termidor in the treated soil. They unwittingly transport it back to their nest, ultimately annihilating the colony.


      The latest formulation of Termidor HE boasts superior dispersion properties, penetrating wider and deeper into the soil while forming a robust bond with soil particles, preventing leaching. It also allows us to drill wider apart in tiled areas. 


      Notably, the active ingredient in Termidor, ***Fipronil***, is employed in pet care products such as Frontline for flea and tick control. What pet owners apply directly to their furry companions, we strategically apply to the soil around your home's perimeter.

      An added assurance is that Termidor HE is produced by BASF, a prominent
      chemical corporation with a strong commitment to quality and operations in
      Australia. They offer accreditation courses to ensure the proper
      application of their product.


      Rest easy, knowing that all Conquer Termites Technicians are fully **licensed** and BASF **accredited**, delivering the highest standard of care.
