      It's great that you're being proactive about termite prevention in your
      home. Here's a summary of the key points you mentioned, based on
      Australian Standards 3660.2:


      1. **Annual Inspections**: It's recommended to have your home inspected for termites at least once a year. This is in line with the Australian Standards 3660.2, which provides guidelines for termite management.

      2. **More Frequent Inspections for Certain Homes**: If your house is older, has specific architectural features, or is located close to wooded areas, you might need to consider more frequent termite inspections. These factors can increase the risk of termite infestation.

      3. **Importance of Chemical Treatments**: Homes without a chemical barrier are more vulnerable to termite infestations. Regular inspections become even more crucial in such cases. Think of these inspections like regular dental check-ups â€“ they are essential for early detection and prevention of problems.


      Ensuring regular termite inspections, especially in the absence of chemical treatments, is a smart approach to protect your home from potential damage. If you haven't scheduled an inspection recently, it might be a good time to do so.
