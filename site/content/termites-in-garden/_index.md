      **Treating Termites in Tree Trunks**: If termites infest a tree, our
      skilled Technicians will drill into the trunk to locate hollow areas
      potentially housing termites. Using a borescope for visual confirmation,
      once termites are detected, we inject a safe, non-repellent transfer
      chemical (Termidor) directly into the tree. This treatment not only
      eradicates termites but also benefits the tree's health by halting
      internal damage. We ensure to seal all drill holes with plugs or sealant
      for a neat finish.

      **Handling Termite-Infested Tree Stumps**: The ideal approach is to prevent termite infestation in tree stumps by removing them entirely. If you've recently had a tree cut down, we recommend having the stump ground out promptly. For stumps already hosting termites or nests, our Technicians can treat them using Termidor before stump removal. This ensures complete termite eradication from your property.
