      Have you just found something in your home or garden and worried it could
      be Termites? Before you go full-on panic mode, check the signs below.  


      ### How do you know if you have Termites?


      It can be a troubling question for an inexperienced homeowner…. 'Is this soft piece of timber a sign of termites'?


      Termites are masters of concealment, navigating through underground tunnels and inside the wooden structures of your home, often undetected. It's not uncommon for their presence to go unnoticed until after they've caused significant damage.


      ### **Five Signs of Termites:**


      **1. Termite tubes or leads**: Termites build mud tubes as a protective shield to access food. If you see mud tubes along your walls or foundation, it strongly indicates termites.


      **2. Hollow or Soft Timbers:** If you tap on wood and it sounds hollow, it may indicate that termites have eaten the inside of the wood. Damaged wood: Termites eat wood from the inside out, causing it to become thin and brittle. If you see any damaged or softwood in your home, it could be a sign of termites.


      **3. Cracked or bubbling paint**: Moisture buildup from termite activity can cause the paint on wooden surfaces to crack or bubble.


      **4. Termite noise**: At the quiet of the night, you might hear a tapping noise or a crunching munching sound.


      **5. Winged Termites -** **Swarms:** Occasionally, termites swarm to start new colonies. If you see a swarm of winged termites (Alates) or find discarded wings, especially near light sources, this could indicate a termite presence.


      ## What are the most common signs of termites?


      ### Mudding - termite trail, lead


      Termites build mud tubes as a protective shield from the elements and predators as they travel from their colony to the food source. These tubes provide the dark, warm, and humid environment they need to survive. 


      The mud tubes are made by mixing soil and termite saliva to form a paste-like substance that dries to a hardness similar to plaster.

      If you see mud tubes along your walls or foundation, it's a strong indication of a termite infestation and you should have a professional inspect your home as **soon** as possible.


      ### Hollow or soft timbers


      Soft pine timber is highly desirable for termites and is often used for door and window frames, skirting boards, and other wood structures in the home. Termites will eat the timber from the inside out, leaving a thin layer between them and the outside world.

      **How can you tell?**


      Tapping on the suspected area and listening for a hollow sound is a simple way to determine if there may be termites present. Using a sharp knife to make a small slit and inspecting the interior of the wood can also provide evidence of termites.


      If you see evidence of termites, you must immediately contact a professional for a thorough inspection and treatment. Sealing the opened area with tape will prevent the termites from fleeing away and allow the inspector to understand the full extent of the problem.


      ### Mudding coming out of a wall


      When you see a 'mud' pack coming out of a wall, it's a clear sign you have termites. It could be a nest behind the wall or a bivouac. A bivouac is not a nest as it doesn't have a nursery where the Queen termite lays eggs.


      It is normally a meeting area to feed the juvenile worker termites or grow their fungus source for their protein.

      ### Cracked or bubbling paint


      Moisture buildup from termite activity can cause paint on wooden surfaces to crack or bubble. When termites consume wood, they produce moisture as a by-product, and if this moisture accumulates in one area, it can cause paint to become damaged.


      If you see cracked or bubbling paint, especially in areas where there may be termite activity, it's important to have a professional inspect your home to determine the cause and take appropriate action to address any termite infestations.

      ### Termite noise - sounds termites make


      Termites have unique ways of communicating with each other, including the use of sounds. When soldiers are alarmed, they will hit their heads against the wood, creating a knocking noise as a signal to evacuate.


      On quiet nights, you may be able to hear the soft gnawing sounds made by worker termites as they scrape and eat the wood.


      If you hear [these sounds](https://www.conquertermites.com.au/inspections/found-termites/termite-sounds/), it's a strong indication of a termite infestation and you should have a professional inspect your home as soon as possible.

      ### Termite Damage of Fungal Decay/Wet Rot?


      Easy to confuse to the untrained eye.


      Termite damage and fungal rot are two **separate** issues that can affect the structure of the wood in a home.


      **Termite damage** occurs when termites consume wood, breaking it down and weakening its structural integrity. This type of damage is often hidden and can go undetected for a long time, leading to significant harm to the structure of a building.


      **Fungal decay**, on the other hand, occurs when certain types of fungi infect the wood, breaking down the cellulose and hemicellulose within it and causing it to become soft and crumbly. A musty odour and visible discolouration of the wood typically accompany this type of damage.


      It's important to differentiate between termite damage and fungal rot, as they require different types of treatment and repair. A professional inspection can help determine the cause of the damage and provide the necessary recommendations for addressing it.

      ### Time to get the professionals in?


      If you suspect that you have termites in your home, it's important to seek the assistance of a professional to determine the extent of the infestation and the best course of action for treatment.


      A Conquer Termites Inspector knows the best way to accurately assess the situation and provide a comprehensive report on what steps need to be taken to eliminate the termites.

      Ever been pottering around in the garden and stumbled upon tiny white bugs
      under a piece of old wood, and wondered if they're termites? Or, even more
      alarming, have you ever poked a finger through a door frame in your house
      and discovered creepy crawlies lurking inside?


      ## What do Termites - White Ants look like in Australia?


      Termites are indeed fascinating creatures, often hidden from sight. They are small, soft-bodied insects that live in large colonies. 


      ### What to do if you think you have found termites?


      1. **Don’t Disturb Them**: Avoid disturbing the termites. This can cause them to scatter potentially making it harder to eradicate them.

      2. **Call a Professional Termite Expert**: Professional pest controllers have the skills, experience, and equipment necessary to effectively deal with termite problems. They can assess the situation, identify the termite species, and determine the best course of action.

      3. **Send us a photo**: For clear confirmation with an expert, send us a photo for quick and free identification.

      ### Are they Termites or White Ants?


      A lot of the lime homeowners confused termites with Black Ants. The confusion stems from their uncanny physical similarities. Both species boast six legs, sport antennae, and live in tight-knit colonies. However, that's where the similarities end, as they differ substantially in body structure and behaviour.

      ### Termite Life Cycle


      Termite appearance can vary slightly depending on their role within the colony. There are three main types of termites in a colony: 


      1. **Worker Termites**: These are the most numerous and are responsible for feeding the colony, building and repairing the nest, and taking care of the young. They are typically about 1/4 to 1/2 inch long, cream-colored, and have no wings.

      2. **Soldier Termites**: Soldiers defend the colony against predators like ants. They are similar in size to workers but can be distinguished by their larger, darker heads and strong mandibles (jaws).

      3. **Reproductive Termites**: These include the king, queen, and alates (winged termites). The queen is much larger than the other termites and can live for several years, laying thousands of eggs. Alates are the ones you might see during certain times of the year when they swarm to start new colonies.
