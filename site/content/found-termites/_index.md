      What is the Difference between Termites and White Ants - NOTHING!


      ## Aussie Talk: White Ants or Termites?


      In true Aussie style, we saw these critters that looked a bit like ants and called them "White Ants." Makes sense, right?


      ### White Ants = Termites?


      But here's the fun fact: what we casually call "White Ants" are actually termites. They're not even close to being real ants, despite looking similar with their six legs and antennae. They live in groups, sure, but that's about all they share. When it comes to body shape and how they behave, they're totally different beasts!

      ## **Don't Panic - Termites Are Normal Here**


      Spotting termites in trees or old stumps? That's pretty standard on the Gold Coast. It might seem worrying, but it's all part of nature's flow.


      Still, it's smart to manage these critters to keep your home safe.


      ### **Why Termites Dig Trees and Stumps**:


      Termites have been munching on trees for ages, especially our Aussie eucalypts. They love the tree's heartwood â€“ it's like their own skyscraper buffet. They get all the food and home they need. But at some stage, they will forage to your home.
