      For new construction projects, implementing termite control measures
      during the building phase (commonly referred to as pre-construction or
      "Pre-Con") is a smart strategy to safeguard the property from future
      termite threats. At Conquer Termites, we offer a range of specialized
      solutions suitable for various construction types and requirements:


      1. **FMC Homeguard**: Available as both a physical sheeting and a parging paint, FMC Homeguard acts as an effective termite barrier. It is specifically engineered to prevent termite entry, providing lasting defence for the new build.

      2. **Greenzone**: This innovative product combines the functions of an expansion joint foam with termite-repellent capabilities. Greenzone is an excellent choice for builders looking for a dual-purpose solution that also repels termites.

      3. **Reticulation System**: A reticulation system is installed along the external perimeter of the building and involves a network of underground pipes. This system is designed for the future reapplication of termite control chemicals, offering a long-term termite management solution without the need for disruptive re-treatment processes.
