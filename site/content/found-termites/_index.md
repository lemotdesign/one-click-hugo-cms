      Ever been pottering around in the garden and stumbled upon tiny white bugs
      under a piece of old wood, and wondered if they're termites? Or, even more
      alarming, have you ever poked a finger through a door frame in your house
      and discovered creepy crawlies lurking inside?


      ## What do Termites - White Ants look like in Australia?


      Termites are indeed fascinating creatures, often hidden from sight. They are small, soft-bodied insects that live in large colonies. 


      ### What to do if you think you have found termites?


      1. **Don’t Disturb Them**: Avoid disturbing the termites. This can cause them to scatter potentially making it harder to eradicate them.

      2. **Call a Professional Termite Expert**: Professional pest controllers have the skills, experience, and equipment necessary to effectively deal with termite problems. They can assess the situation, identify the termite species, and determine the best course of action.

      3. **Send us a photo**: For clear confirmation with an expert, send us a photo for quick and free identification.

      ### Are they Termites or White Ants?


      A lot of the lime homeowners confused termites with Black Ants. The confusion stems from their uncanny physical similarities. Both species boast six legs, sport antennae, and live in tight-knit colonies. However, that's where the similarities end, as they differ substantially in body structure and behaviour.

      ### Termite Life Cycle


      Termite appearance can vary slightly depending on their role within the colony. There are three main types of termites in a colony: 


      1. **Worker Termites**: These are the most numerous and are responsible for feeding the colony, building and repairing the nest, and taking care of the young. They are typically about 1/4 to 1/2 inch long, cream-colored, and have no wings.

      2. **Soldier Termites**: Soldiers defend the colony against predators like ants. They are similar in size to workers but can be distinguished by their larger, darker heads and strong mandibles (jaws).

      3. **Reproductive Termites**: These include the king, queen, and alates (winged termites). The queen is much larger than the other termites and can live for several years, laying thousands of eggs. Alates are the ones you might see during certain times of the year when they swarm to start new colonies.

      What is the Difference between Termites and White Ants?


      ## Embrace the Australian Vernacular


      In Australia, we've always had a knack for calling things exactly as we see them. Once upon a time, when we laid our eyes on these tiny, communal-dwelling creatures that bore a striking resemblance to ants, we dubbed them "White Ants." It seemed like a logical name at the time.


      ### Are white ants the same as termites?


      But here's the twist: Termites, affectionately referred to as "White Ants" Down Under, are not ants by any stretch of the imagination. The confusion stems from their uncanny physical similarities. Both species boast six legs, sport antennae, and live in tight-knit colonies. However, that's where the similarities end, as they differ substantially in body structure and behaviour.


      ### Difference Between Termites & Black Ants

      ### Let's Dive into the Science


      From a scientific perspective, Termites belong to the cockroach family, specifically the sub-order of Blattodea, whereas Ants are part of the wasp family, known as the Order Hymenoptera. Termites lack the segmented bodies that are characteristic of ants.


      ### The Fundamental Distinction


      In a nutshell: Black ants might raid your kitchen and nibble on the food you've left out, but Termites, often dubbed "White Ants," have a more destructive appetite—they'll feast on your very home!


      ### Black Ants don't keep Termites away!

      Termites, often dubbed the "silent destroyers," have a knack for making
      themselves known only after they've caused significant damage. But how do
      these tiny critters seemingly pop up out of nowhere?


      ## Should I panic about termites?


      Have you just found evidence of termites in your home and wondered how they came in? You hadn’t seen any signs of termites, mud leads, or termite trails, but suddenly they appear in your home!


      Termites are **constantly** foraging around your house in subterranean tunnels that are usually only a foot under the ground. First, they might seek moisture in your home, like a leaky shower tray or dripping tap. But the main prize is all the edible timber in your house. Mean to say, termites regard your home as ‘one large tree’.

      ![Subterranean termite attacking a home](img/termites-attacking-a-house.png)


      **1. Silent Workers:** Termites are notoriously discreet and enter your home in a concealed manner. They operate in the dark, concealed spaces of your home like within walls, under floorboards, or in any other tiny crevice they can find. This means they can be feasting on your home's structure for a long time before any obvious signs emerge.


      **2. Rapid Reproduction:** One of the reasons termites seem to appear suddenly is their impressive rate of reproduction. A single termite queen can lay thousands of eggs daily, leading to large colonies forming quickly and discreetly. A couple of years ago, there might just not have been a termite nest near your home.


      **3. Swarmers:** On the Gold Coast, from October to February, mature termite colonies release swarmers (Alates) – winged termites whose primary goal is to start new colonies. If you spot a group of winged insects inside or around your home, it's possible they've been there for a while and are now seeking a place to set up home!


      **4. Underground Movement:** Subterranean (under the ground) termites, are the most common type on the Gold Coast. They construct mud tubes to traverse between their underground home and their food source (your house!). These mud tubes protect them from predators and the environment, making their movement and presence hidden.

      **5. Your home is a Timber Buffet for Termites:** Once the termites have determined a timber structure above them, they will build subterranean tunnels from their nest to gain concealed entry. For them, your house is the trophy tree!


      **There is a lot of timber in your house.**


      The latest data from a long-running FWPA project demonstrates that Australia’s average one- and two-storey detached house used 14.58 m3 of wood (2017-18).


      ![Volume of timber in an average house in Australia](img/how-much-timber-termites-can-eat-in-your-home.png)


      **[Termites eat hardwood](https://www.conquertermites.com.au/admin/#/collections/article/entries/2023-01-11-will-termites-white-ants-eat-hardwood) too.**


      Termites will eat all types of timber, but they are super clever in sourcing the wood with the most desirable nutrients and cellulose. It’s all about efficient foraging and a balanced diet for the colony.


      A big mistake Australian homeowners make is thinking their home is constructed with hardwood, when in fact, it is just plantation eucalyptus (gum trees). Yes, it is considerably harder than radiata pine, but it is highly desirable timber for termites to eat.


      Eucalyptus timbers are the most effective wood to use in bait stations to attract termites. Not saying your home is a big bait station, but it is the ultimate feeding Buffett for termites.


      #### Don't wait until you see evidence of termites - Act now and get your home inspected


      Termites don't appear out of nowhere; they've usually been around for longer than you realize. 


      Regular home inspections and being aware of the subtle signs of their presence can help in early detection, preventing extensive damage to your home. 


      Remember, it's always easier to tackle a termite problem in its early stages than after they've firmly established themselves.
