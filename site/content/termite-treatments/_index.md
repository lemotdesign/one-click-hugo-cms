      It's super scary to think you might have termites in your home. Termites
      don't want to be found and feed and move in a concealed manner and you're
      not the termite expert.


      ### **Five Signs of Termites:**


      **1. Termite tubes or leads**: Termites build mud tubes as a protective shield to access food. If you see mud tubes along your walls or foundation, it strongly indicates termites.


      **2. Hollow or Soft Timbers:** If you tap on wood and it sounds hollow, it may indicate that termites have eaten the inside of the wood. Damaged wood: Termites eat wood from the inside out, causing it to become thin and brittle. If you see any damaged or softwood in your home, it could be a sign of termites.


      **3. Cracked or bubbling paint**: Moisture buildup from termite activity can cause the paint on wooden surfaces to crack or bubble.


      **4. Termite noise**: At the quiet of the night, you might hear a tapping noise or a crunching munching sound.


      **5. Winged Termites -** **Swarms:** Occasionally, termites swarm to start new colonies. If you see a swarm of winged termites (Alates) or find discarded wings, especially near light sources, this could indicate a termite presence.

      In the search for the most formidable defence against termites, you must
      look beyond just effectiveness. There are no guaranteed absolutes in
      termite prevention, and treatment plans can vary in success. 


      #### Consider these essential factors when choosing a termite control provider:


      1. **Proven Effectiveness**: The chemical should consistently stop termite activity.

      2. **Safety Commitment**: The health of your family and the environment should not be compromised.

      3. **Lasting Protection**: The duration of the chemical's effectiveness.

      4. **Value for Money**: Invest in a solution that offers the best return, not just the lowest price.

      5. **Quality Service**: A professional team should ensure your property is left neat post-treatment. The care factor matters.
