      1. **Mud tubes or mudding:** Termites build mud tubes as a protective
      shield to access food. If you see mud tubes along your walls or
      foundation, it strongly indicates termites.

      2. **Damaged wood:** Termites eat wood from the inside out, causing it to become thin and brittle. If you see any damaged or softwood in your home, it could be a sign of termites.

      3. **Hollow sounds:** If you tap on wood and it sounds hollow, it may indicate that termites have eaten the inside of the wood.

      4. **Cracked or bubbling paint:** Moisture build-up from termite activity can cause the paint on wooden surfaces to crack or bubble.

      5. **Termite noise:** They make a tapping or ‘crunching munching’ sound.

      Mud tubes are an essential protective shield for termites as they travel
      from their colony to their food source, shielding them from the elements
      and predators. The tubes provide a warm, humid, and dark environment for
      these insects to survive.\

      \

      They construct the tubes by blending soil and termite saliva to create a plaster-like substance that dries to a hard texture.\

      \

      If you observe mud tubes along your walls or foundation, it is a clear indication of termite infestation, and you should promptly seek the assistance of a professional\

      to inspect your home.

  - heading: Mudding coming out of a wall
    text: >-
      When you see a 'mud' pack coming out of a wall, it clearly shows you have
      termites. It could be a nest behind the wall or a bivouac. A bivouac is
      not a nest as it doesn't have a nursery where the Queen termite lays
      eggs.\

      \

      It is usually a meeting area to feed the juvenile worker termites or grow their fungus source for their protein.

  - heading: Hollow or soft timbers
    text: >-
      Soft pine timber is highly desirable for termites and is often used for
      door and window frames, skirting boards, and other wood structures in the
      home.\

      \

      Termites will eat the timber from the inside out, leaving a thin layer between them and the outside world.

    text: >-
      ### Tapping on the suspected area and listening for a hollow sound is a
      simple way to determine if termites are present. Using a sharp knife to
      make a small slit and inspecting the interior of the wood can also provide
      evidence of termites.


      If you see evidence of termites, you must immediately contact a professional for a thorough inspection and treatment. Sealing the opened area with tape will prevent the termites from fleeing away and allow the inspector to understand the full extent of the problem.
