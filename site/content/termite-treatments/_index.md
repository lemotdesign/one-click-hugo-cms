      1. **Mudding - termite trail, lead:** Termites build mud tubes as a
      protective shield to access food. If you see mud tubes along your walls or
      foundation, it strongly indicates termites.


      Mud tubes are an essential protective shield for termites as they travel from their colony to their food source, shielding them from the elements and predators. The tubes provide a warm, humid, and dark environment for these insects to survive.\

      \

      They construct the tubes by blending soil and termite saliva to create a plaster-like substance that dries to a hard texture.\

      \

      If you observe mud tubes along your walls or foundation, it is a clear indication of termite infestation, and you should promptly seek the assistance of a professional to inspect your home.


      When you see a 'mud' pack coming out of a wall, it clearly shows you have termites. It could be a nest behind the wall or a bivouac. A bivouac is not a nest as it doesn't have a nursery where the Queen termite lays eggs.\

      \

      It is usually a meeting area to feed the juvenile worker termites or grow their fungus source for their protein.


      1. **Damaged wood:** Termites eat wood from the inside out, causing it to become thin and brittle. If you see any damaged or softwood in your home, it could be a sign of termites.

      2. **Hollow sounds:** If you tap on wood and it sounds hollow, it may indicate that termites have eaten the inside of the wood.


      Soft pine timber is highly desirable for termites and is often used for door and window frames, skirting boards, and other wood structures in the home.\

      \

      Termites will eat the timber from the inside out, leaving a thin layer between them and the outside world.


      1. **Cracked or bubbling paint:** Moisture build-up from termite activity can cause the paint on wooden surfaces to crack or bubble.

      2. **Termite noise:** They make a tapping or ‘crunching munching’ sound.
