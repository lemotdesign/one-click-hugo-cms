      It's super scary to think you might have termites in your home. Termites
      don't want to be found and feed and move in a concealed manner and you're
      not the termite expert.


      ### **Five Signs of Termites:**


      **1. Termite tubes or leads**: Termites build mud tubes as a protective shield to access food. If you see mud tubes along your walls or foundation, it strongly indicates termites.


      **2. Hollow or Soft Timbers:** If you tap on wood and it sounds hollow, it may indicate that termites have eaten the inside of the wood. Damaged wood: Termites eat wood from the inside out, causing it to become thin and brittle. If you see any damaged or softwood in your home, it could be a sign of termites.


      **3. Cracked or bubbling paint**: Moisture buildup from termite activity can cause the paint on wooden surfaces to crack or bubble.


      **4. Termite noise**: At the quiet of the night, you might hear a tapping noise or a crunching munching sound.


      **5. Winged Termites -** **Swarms:** Occasionally, termites swarm to start new colonies. If you see a swarm of winged termites (Alates) or find discarded wings, especially near light sources, this could indicate a termite presence.

      For new construction projects, implementing termite control measures
      during the building phase (commonly referred to as pre-construction or
      "Pre-Con") is a smart strategy to safeguard the property from future
      termite threats. At Conquer Termites, we offer a range of specialized
      solutions suitable for various construction types and requirements:


      1. **FMC Homeguard**: Available as both a physical sheeting and a parging paint, FMC Homeguard acts as an effective termite barrier. It is specifically engineered to prevent termite entry, providing lasting defence for the new build.

      2. **Greenzone**: This innovative product combines the functions of an expansion joint foam with termite-repellent capabilities. Greenzone is an excellent choice for builders looking for a dual-purpose solution that also repels termites.

      3. **Reticulation System**: A reticulation system is installed along the external perimeter of the building and involves a network of underground pipes. This system is designed for the future reapplication of termite control chemicals, offering a long-term termite management solution without the need for disruptive re-treatment processes.
