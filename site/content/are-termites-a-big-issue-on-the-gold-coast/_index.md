      ## Gold Coast homes are very vulnerable to Termite Attack


      A question many homeowners ask our technicians; “Is the Gold Coast a bad area for termites”? Meaning, is their home located in an area where they are more susceptible to a termite attack. 


      **Fact**: Termites can be foraging in **any** suburb on the Gold Coast at **any** time!


      But to answer that question properly you need to consider the macro and micro environmental factors that influence termites.


      ### Gold Coast is in a High-Risk Area for Termites


      On a **macro level**, Gold Coast is located in a **high-risk** area, as illustrated by the CISRO map. Homes in these areas are at higher risk of being attacked by termites due to the high mean temperature experienced through winter and high rainfalls year round. 


      Termite nests need to be maintained at a temperature between 25°C - 36°C. (Australian Museum). Basically, the cooler it gets, the fewer the termites. That is why Tasmania and New Zealand are termite-free (lucky them!).

      On a **Micro level**, (these are the factors you can see and deal with around your home). You can actually influence the outcome of your home being, or not being, attacked by termites. 


      #### **For example:**


      * Large native trees (Gum Trees) near your home - a favourite nesting place for termites 

      * Moisture in the ground near the house - provides conducive conditions for the termites - that leaking shower or tap

      * Construction of the house - structural timbers might be in direct contact with the soil allowing direct entry.

      * Tree stumps, wooden retaining walls and loose timbers on the ground allow a higher population of termites to thrive near your home.

      * Current chemical treatment - this is the biggest positive or negative factor in preventing termites from attacking your home.


      Control the things you can control and ensure your home is not one of the thousand attacked by termites on the Gold Coast annually.
