Termite infestations are a serious issue for homeowners in Brisbane and the Gold Coast. With our warm climate and high humidity, termites thrive, making it essential to have effective control measures in place. This guide explores the most reliable termite treatment options available today, helping you protect your home from costly damage.

### **1. Dust Treatments**

Dust treatments work by allowing termites to ingest and spread insecticide throughout their colony during grooming. This method is particularly useful when applied directly to active termites found inside a structure.

* **Insect Growth Regulator (IGR) Dusts** â€“ These, such as Triflumuron, are among the safest options for human occupants and effectively disrupt termite development.
* **Non-Repellent Termiticides** â€“ These ensure termites unknowingly spread the treatment to their colony, leading to gradual but effective control.
* **Arsenic Trioxide Dust** â€“ An older, highly toxic method that is rarely used today due to its environmental and health risks.

### **2. Baiting Systems**

Baiting is one of the most effective ways to eliminate an entire termite colony, especially when the nest cannot be located.

* Bait stations contain cellulose-based materials such as timber or cellulose gel, which are placed in the ground or inside the structure near termite activity.
* Non-repellent, slow-acting toxins allow termites to carry the poison back to the colony before they detect its effects.
* Unlike chemical barriers, baiting does not prevent future infestations, making ongoing monitoring and professional treatment essential.

### **3. Chemical Barriers**

Chemical barriers are a long-lasting method of termite prevention, forming a treated zone around a structure that termites cannot pass through.

* **Application Process:** A continuous pesticide boundary is applied around a buildingâ€™s foundations, either by trenching around the perimeter or injecting chemicals into the soil through drilled holes in concrete areas.
* **How It Works:** Termites unknowingly pick up the chemical, transferring it back to their colony, reducing the population and potentially eliminating the nest.
* **Repellent vs. Non-Repellent Chemicals:**

  * *Repellent Termiticides* (e.g., Bifenthrin) prevent termites from entering treated zones.
  * *Non-Repellent Termiticides* (e.g., Imidacloprid, Fipronil) allow termites to move through treated areas, ensuring they carry the toxicant back to the colony for widespread control.
* **Pre-Construction Protection:** Some chemical barriers, such as Bifenthrin, can be applied before a building is constructed to protect against future infestations.

### **4. Physical Barriers**

Physical barriers are a non-toxic solution, commonly used in new constructions to block termite access.

* **Types of Physical Barriers:**

  * **Crushed Granite:** When installed around foundations and pipes, termites cannot move the particles due to their size and weight.
  * **Stainless Steel Mesh:** A fine, marine-grade mesh glued to concrete slabs or wrapped around pipes prevents termites from passing through.
  * **Metal Sheeting & Ant Caps:** Installed on brick piers or under suspended timber floors, forcing termites to build visible mud tubes, making detection easier.
  * **Chemically Impregnated Sheets:** Polymer films or fabrics infused with termiticide, such as deltamethrin or bifenthrin, create an additional layer of protection.

### **5. Reducing Termite Risk in Your Home**

Aside from professional treatments, homeowners can take steps to reduce the risk of termite infestations:

* **Limit moisture** â€“ Ensure proper drainage, fix leaks, and keep subfloors well-ventilated and dry.
* **Use termite-resistant timber** â€“ Species such as Red Gum and White Cypress Pine offer natural resistance to termites.
* **Avoid timber-to-soil contact** â€“ Do not store timber directly on the ground or near your home.
* **Chemically treated timber** â€“ Modern treatments with quaternary ammonium compounds provide long-term termite protection without the use of arsenic.
