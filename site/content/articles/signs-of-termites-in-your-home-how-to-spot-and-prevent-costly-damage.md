**Signs of Termites in Your Home: How to Spot and Prevent Costly Damage**

\
Termites are silent invaders, capable of causing severe damage to homes without immediate detection. Whether they are tunnelling through walls, eating away at subfloors, or nesting in roof voids, recognising the signs of termites early is crucial to safeguarding your property. This guide, complete with videos showcasing real termite damage, will help you identify warning signs and understand the extent of their destructive capabilities.

With recent hot, humid weather and rain across Brisbane and the Gold Coast, termite activity has surged. We've received an influx of calls from homeowners spotting termites swarming and finding evidence of their destructive presence in walls, subfloors, and roof voids. This guide, complete with video insights, highlights key visible signs of termite activity to help you protect your property during this peak season.

**1. Recognising Termite Damage in Walls**

Termites often target the walls of homes due to their proximity to moisture and timber. Common signs include:

* **Bubbling or cracked paint** – a result of termites tunnelling beneath the surface.
* **Hollow-sounding timber** – tap on skirting boards or door frames to check for internal damage.
* **Mud tubes** – visible trails termites use to move between their nest and food sources.

**2. Subfloor Damage: The Hidden Threat Below**

Subfloors are particularly vulnerable to termite infestations due to their direct contact with soil and moisture. Key indicators include:

* **Sagging or uneven floors** – a sign of weakened support structures.
* **Damaged joists and bearers** – termites often compromise the strength of structural timber.
* **Mud trails along foundations** – visible evidence of termite activity beneath the home.

**3. Termite Activity in Roof Voids**

Roof voids can be an unexpected hotspot for termites. Look for:

* **Damaged roof trusses** – weakened timber beams affecting the roof’s stability.
* **Termite nests** – large, hardened mounds or arboreal nests.
* **Drooping ceilings** – resulting from compromised structural timber.

Delaying termite treatment can lead to significant structural damage and costly repairs. Homeowners in Brisbane and the Gold Coast should schedule regular termite inspections, especially if signs like those mentioned above are present.
