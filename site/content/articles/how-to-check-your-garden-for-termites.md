**Key Signs to Check Your Garden for Termites**

If you’re wondering, *“What do I do if I think I have termites in my garden?”*, start by inspecting the following areas where termites are most likely to be found.

**1. Loose Timbers or Logs**

Termites love damp, hidden timber sources, making loose timbers or logs an ideal spot for termite colonies. Lift any firewood, fallen branches, or loose timbers lying on the soil, and inspect underneath for live termites or termite damage and mud tubes. These are signs that termites are actively feeding on the wood.

 

**2. Fence Bases in Contact with Soil**

Timber fences that make contact with soil are common entry points for termites. Check each fence post, particularly the base where it touches the soil, for signs of mud tubes. These tubes look like thin, dirt-filled tunnels and are a clear indication of termite activity, as termites use them to travel and stay moist.

 

**3. Mud Trails or Tubes on Surfaces**

Mud tubes are one of the easiest ways to spot termites in your garden. These tubes help termites travel safely between their colony and a food source. Look for them along the base of your fence posts, near tree roots, or on any timber structures in the garden.

 

**4. Live Termites or Nests (Mounds and Arboreal Nests)**

Some termite species in Queensland build visible nests, either as mound structures on the ground or arboreal nests in trees. If you’re concerned about *“what to do if you find a termite mound in your yard,”* it’s best to observe without disturbing them and contact a pest professional. Large termite nests often mean an established colony nearby.

 

**5. Around Trees, Tree stumps and Mulched Garden Beds**

Mulched areas and tree bases are especially attractive to termites due to the damp, dark conditions. Inspect around trees, particularly near exposed roots or damaged bark, and lift sections of mulch to check for mud tubes, live termites, or any disturbed soil. If you’re wondering *“how do I check mulch for termites,”* remember that mulch and tree bases need to be inspected gently, as termites can scatter if disturbed.

**Why Treating Garden Termites Is Essential to Protect Your Home**

If you think you’ve found termites in your garden, it’s essential to treat them to *prevent termite infestations* from spreading to your home. Even if termites appear limited to the garden, they can quickly grow in numbers and migrate closer to your house, putting it under “termite pressure.” This increased presence means a greater risk of termites targeting your home’s wooden structures and foundation.

Regular checks and treatment of termites in your garden can reduce termite pressure around your home, lowering the chances of a structural infestation.

**What to Do If You Find Termites in Your Garden**

If you’re asking, *“What should I do if I have termites in my garden?”* follow these steps to ensure effective treatment and avoid aggravating the problem.

**Don’t Disturb Them**

Avoid physically disturbing termites or their mud tubes. Disrupting them can cause termites to scatter, making it harder to locate and properly treat the infestation.

**Avoid Spraying Insecticide**

It may be tempting to spray termites with standard insecticides, but this can often worsen the problem. Spraying may kill a few termites on the surface but drives the rest of the colony deeper underground, making professional treatment less effective. If you’ve searched, *“Should I spray termites myself?”*, the answer is no—it’s best to contact professionals.
