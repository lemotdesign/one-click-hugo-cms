**Cane Toads and Pets: What You Need to Know**

Cane toads are a common sight in many parts of Queensland, including Brisbane and the Gold Coast. While these invasive amphibians may seem harmless, they pose a significant risk to pets due to their highly toxic secretions. Homeowners frequently ask us about managing cane toads, and while Conquer Termites does not treat cane toads directly, we understand the concerns they bring to households. Hereâ€™s what you need to know about cane toads and how to protect your pets.

**Invasive pest** 

Cane toads were introduced to Australia in 1935 as a biological control method to combat cane beetles, which were damaging sugarcane crops in Queensland. However, this plan backfired, as the toads failed to control the beetles and instead became an invasive species. With no natural predators in Australia, they spread rapidly, disrupting ecosystems and posing a serious risk to native wildlife and pets due to their toxic secretions.

**Why Are Cane Toads a Problem?**

Cane toads secrete a potent toxin from glands behind their heads, which can be fatal to pets if ingested or even licked. Dogs and cats are especially vulnerable, as they may try to bite or play with these toads, not realising the danger. The toxin can cause severe symptoms such as:

* Excessive drooling and foaming at the mouth
* Pawing at the mouth
* Vomiting
* Disorientation or seizures
* Irregular heartbeat

If you suspect your pet has been exposed to cane toad toxin, rinse their mouth out with water (ensuring they donâ€™t swallow) and seek veterinary attention immediately.

**How to Reduce Cane Toads Around Your Home**

While professional pest control services do not typically target cane toads, there are several steps you can take to minimise their presence in your yard:

* **Remove standing water** â€“ Cane toads breed in water sources like ponds, pet bowls, and even blocked drains. Eliminating these reduces their ability to reproduce.
* **Use barriers** â€“ Fine mesh fencing around garden beds or pet areas can help keep cane toads out.
* **Reduce outdoor lighting** â€“ Lights attract insects, which in turn attract cane toads looking for food.
* **Keep your yard tidy** â€“ Remove clutter, fallen leaves, and debris where cane toads may hide during the day.

**Safe Cane Toad Removal**

If you find cane toads in your yard, you can safely remove them by:

* Wearing gloves and placing them in a sealed container.
* Freezing them for humane euthanasia, as per RSPCA recommendations.
* Contacting local wildlife authorities for advice on safe removal methods.

**Protecting Your Pets**

Preventing exposure is the best way to keep your pets safe from cane toad poisoning. Supervise pets at night when toads are most active, and train dogs to avoid them. If you live in an area with a high cane toad population, consider installing barriers around pet-friendly zones.

While cane toads are not a pest that Conquer Termites treats, we often receive questions about them from homeowners concerned about their impact. If you need professional pest control for other unwanted invaders like termites, ants, or cockroaches, our team is here to help.
