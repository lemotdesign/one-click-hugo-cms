  homes on the Gold Coast are just as vulnerable to termite attacks as timber
  homes—because termites aren’t after bricks, they’re after the timber framing
  inside. At Conquer Termites, we’ve seen firsthand how termites sneak through
  slab edges, gaps, and weep holes. Book your inspection today and protect your
  home before it’s too late.

One of the most common statements we hear from homeowners is: *“My house is made of brick, so I don’t need to worry about termites.”* It’s a widespread belief—but unfortunately, it’s not true.

At Conquer Termites, we’ve inspected and treated many **brick homes with active termite infestations**. The problem isn’t the bricks themselves—it’s the false sense of security they create.

### **Why Brick Homes Are Not Safe from Termites**

Bricks may look solid and protective, but most homes in our region are **brick veneer constructions**. That means the bricks form an outer shell, while the internal structure—the framework, skirting boards, door frames, and roof timbers—is all **timber**. That’s what termites are after.

Termites don’t need to chew through bricks. Instead, they use hidden paths to gain access to your home, such as:

* Cracks in concrete slabs or mortar joints
* Gaps behind rendered walls
* Weep holes that are bridged or covered by landscaping
* Slab edges hidden by tiles, decks, or soil
* Pipe penetrations and expansion joints

Once inside, termites travel unseen through wall cavities, floors, and even roof voids. Because brick walls conceal their entry points, **infestations often go unnoticed until damage is well underway.**

### **Real-Life Example: Termite Trouble in a Brick Home in Capalaba**

We were recently called to a brick home in **Capalaba** where the homeowner had noticed termites in their garage. They had sprayed the area multiple times, and each time, more dead termites would appear. But the activity didn’t stop.

By the time we arrived, **hundreds of dead termites** had collected in the garage, and the homeowner was frustrated that the problem kept returning.

Our inspection revealed that termites were entering through a hidden slab edge near the garage wall—something a surface spray couldn’t fix. The real issue was a nearby colony that hadn’t been treated. While the homeowner kept killing the visible foragers, the source of the infestation remained untouched, and the damage continued behind the scenes.

This is a classic case of how even a solid-looking brick home can be compromised by termites—and why relying on sprays or DIY solutions can leave you exposed.

### **Don’t Be Fooled by the Bricks**

Just because you can’t see termites doesn’t mean they’re not there. The concealed design of brick homes often works in the termite’s favour, hiding signs of damage until it’s too late.

Whether your home is brick, timber, or a mix of both, **regular inspections are essential**. Only a professional can check entry points, inspect concealed areas, and identify the signs that something isn’t right.
