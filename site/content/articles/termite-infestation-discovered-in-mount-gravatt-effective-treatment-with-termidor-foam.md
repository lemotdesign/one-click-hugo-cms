**Termite Attack on a Home in Mount Gravatt: How We Stopped Them with Termidor Foam**

Termites can silently cause significant damage to a home before being discovered. During a **routine termite inspection** at a property in **Mount Gravatt**, our **senior technician, Carlo,** identified an active termite infestation in the structural timbers.

### **The Termite Infestation: What We Found**

During the inspection, Carlo identified termite workings inside several **floor joists and behind the sheeting next to concrete posts**. The infestation was particularly severe in these structural timbers, where termites had created mud galleries, allowing them to travel undetected. Our moisture meter and Termatrac device confirmed high moisture levels, further indicating termite activity. Immediate action was necessary to prevent further damage.

### **Initial Treatment with Termidor Foam**

To target the active termites inside the infested timbers, we applied **Termidor Foam**. This highly effective foam expands within the termite galleries, ensuring deep penetration into hidden areas where termites are actively feeding. Unlike surface sprays, Termidor Foam is designed to be **non-repellent**, meaning termites unknowingly transfer it throughout the colony, leading to colony elimination over time.

#### **Why Termidor Foam?**

* **Expands inside timber voids** – Reaches concealed areas where termites are active.
* **Non-repellent formula** – Ensures termites spread the treatment without detecting it.
* **Highly effective for localised infestations** – Perfect for treating termites inside wall cavities and timber structures.

### **Next Steps for Long-Term Protection**

While Termidor Foam provides an immediate knockdown of termites in the affected areas, a more comprehensive approach is required to protect the home from future attacks. We advised the homeowner on **a full termite management system**, which includes a chemical treatment around the property using Termidor HE. This ensures long-term protection by creating an undetectable treated zone that termites cannot bypass.
