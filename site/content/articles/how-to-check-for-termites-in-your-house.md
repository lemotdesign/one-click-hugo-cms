**1. Inspect High-Risk Indoor Areas**

* **Walls and Skirting Boards**: Subterranean termites often enter homes through small gaps around skirting boards or cracks in walls. Areas like bathrooms, kitchens, and laundries are particularly vulnerable due to their higher moisture levels. Moist timber in these spaces is easier for termites to consume, especially if fungal decay is present, as this further weakens the timber. Pay close attention to skirting boards or wall corners in these rooms for mud tubes or softened surfaces that may signal termite activity.
* **Roof Voids**: Roof voids are common hiding spots for termites, as they’re dark, undisturbed, and contain timber structures. Check timber beams in the roof void for signs of hollowing, mud trails, or fungal decay, which can attract termites and indicate areas they’re more likely to infest.

**2. Check Timber Fixtures and Furniture**

* **Hollow-Sounding Timber**: Tap on exposed timber surfaces such as door frames, walls, and floorboards. Hollow-sounding timber can suggest termite tunneling within, especially in moisture-prone rooms where fungal decay might also be present, making the timber even more attractive to termites.
* **Warped Doors and Windows**: Termite activity within timber can cause doors and windows to warp or stick, making them harder to open and close. This warping is often more noticeable in areas like kitchens, bathrooms, and laundries where humidity is higher, creating ideal conditions for termites and encouraging decay in the timber.
* **Cracks in Paint or Bubbling Surfaces**: Tunnels behind walls can lead to cracked or bubbling paint. Inspect areas around skirting boards or in humid rooms for changes in paint texture, which may indicate termite presence or weakened timber due to decay.

**3. Look for Mud Tubes**

Subterranean termites build mud tubes to protect themselves as they travel from the soil to timber structures. These tubes can sometimes appear on walls, skirting boards, or even on timber furniture inside your home. The presence of mud tubes is a strong indicator of active termite presence and should be addressed promptly.

**What to Do if You Discover Termites in Your Home**

If you spot any signs of termites, avoid disturbing the area and do not spray termites with household insecticides. DIY treatments or handling termites directly can often cause them to retreat deeper into the structure, making the infestation harder to eliminate. Contact Conquer Termites for a professional termite inspection and advice on a thorough assessment and effective treatment plan.
