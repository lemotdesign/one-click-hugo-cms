## **Termite Damage vs. Wood Rot: How to Tell the Difference**

When timber in your home starts showing signs of damage, it’s critical to identify the cause quickly. Is it termites silently eating away at your timber, or is it fungal decay (wood rot) caused by moisture? While both can compromise structural integrity, they have very different causes and require specific solutions.

This guide will help you easily identify the differences so you can take the right steps to protect your property.

### **What is Termite Damage?**

Termites are silent invaders that consume timber for its cellulose content. They work from the inside out, leaving timber hollow and structurally weak.

#### **Signs of Termite Damage:**

1. **Hollow-Sounding Timber:** Tap on exposed timbers like door frames or skirting boards. If it sounds hollow, termites could be eating it from within.
2. **Mud Tubes:** Termites create muddy tunnels along surfaces like walls and foundations to protect themselves as they move.
3. **Clean Tunnels or Galleries:** Inside affected timber, termites leave smooth, clean tunnels as they hollow out the timber.
4. **Swarming Termites:** During humid weather, flying termites (alates) can appear, leaving behind discarded wings near windows or lights.

#### **Common Areas to Check:**

* Skirting boards
* Door and window frames
* Roof void timbers
* Subfloor joists and bearers

### **What is Wood Rot (Fungal Decay)?**

Wood rot occurs when fungi grow in timber exposed to consistent moisture. Unlike termites, fungi do not consume timber but instead break it down, causing it to decay over time.

#### **Signs of Wood Rot:**

1. **Soft, Crumbling Timber:** Rotting timber feels spongy to the touch and crumbles easily when pressure is applied.
2. **Discolouration:** Affected timber often darkens, appearing brown, grey, or black.
3. **Cracked or Splintered Appearance:** As rot progresses, timber can split into cube-like or layered fragments.
4. **Musty, Damp Odour:** Wood rot often produces a strong mouldy smell.

#### **Common Areas to Check:**

* Timber in constant contact with moisture (e.g., around leaks, windows, or gutters)
* Subfloor timber with poor ventilation
* Wooden decking and outdoor timbers exposed to rain

### **How to Tell the Difference Between Termite Damage and Wood Ro**

### **Why Early Detection is Crucial**

Both termite damage and wood rot can compromise the safety of your home. However, termite infestations tend to escalate quickly, causing widespread damage if left untreated.

#### **Termite Damage:**

* Requires professional termite treatment to stop and control the infestation.
* Preventative termite inspections are essential, especially in areas like Brisbane and the Gold Coast, where termites thrive in warm, humid conditions.

#### **Wood Rot:**

* Fix moisture issues (e.g., leaks, poor drainage) to stop fungal growth.
* Replace affected timber and improve ventilation to prevent recurrence.
