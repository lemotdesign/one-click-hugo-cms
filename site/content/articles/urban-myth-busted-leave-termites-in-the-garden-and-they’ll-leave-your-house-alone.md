  House Alone?"

  Termites in the Garden? Why Ignoring Them Could Put Your Gold Coast Home at
  Risk

  There’s a common myth that if you leave termites alone in your garden, they won’t enter your home. But at Conquer Termites, we’ve seen firsthand how wrong this belief can be. A recent case showed termites moving from a backyard tree stump directly into a home’s subfloor, causing extensive internal damage.


  On the Gold Coast, tree stumps, retaining walls, old sleepers, and loose timber all create ideal conditions for termite colonies to thrive—and eventually spread to your house. In many cases, we find multiple termite species living in one yard.


  If you spot signs of termites in your garden, don’t wait. Contact Conquer Termites for a thorough inspection and expert treatment options, including fast-acting Termidor Foam for active infestations.

At Conquer Termites, we often hear homeowners say, *“If I leave the termites alone in my garden, they won’t bother my house.”* Unfortunately, this belief is not only false—it’s potentially **costly**.

A recent job in **East Brisbane** proves just how wrong this myth can be. When we inspected the property, we found **extensive termite damage** at the front of the house. Termites had entered through the **subfloor**, silently causing damage behind the walls. At the same time, we discovered **live termites in a tree stump** in the backyard—just metres from the home.

The termites were **treated immediately** on the day of inspection using **Termidor Foam**, applied to all active areas.

### The Truth About Garden Termites

Leaving termites alone in your garden won’t protect your house. In fact, **the more food sources they have in your yard, the stronger the colony becomes**.

We often find:

* **Tree stumps, loose timber, old sleepers, trees, and retaining walls** all serving as prime feeding sites.
* Multiple **active colonies** in a single yard, sometimes even with **different species of termites** working in the same area.
* Termites using garden timbers as a launching pad straight into nearby homes.

### Why This Myth is So Dangerous

* **Proximity = risk** – If termites are in your yard, they’re close enough to attack your home.
* **Subfloor access is common** – Moist, hidden entry points make timber subfloors a prime target.
* **Garden food makes them stronger** – More available timber allows colonies to grow larger and faster.

Leaving them undisturbed gives them **time to expand** and **resources to thrive**, which can lead to serious internal damage before you even realise they’ve moved in.

### Real Example from East Brisbane (Watch the Video)

In the video below, you’ll see just how quickly things can escalate. Despite appearing limited to a backyard stump, termites had already caused serious structural damage to the house.

📍 *Location:* East Brisbane\
🪵 *Findings:* Live termites in tree stump + active infestation through the subfloor\
