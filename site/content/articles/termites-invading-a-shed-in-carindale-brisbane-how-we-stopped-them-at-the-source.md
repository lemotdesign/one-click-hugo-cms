  Gold Coast Termite Risk: How Termites Can Enter Your Property


  Even in modern structures, termites can find their way in through hidden gaps. At Conquer Termites Gold Coast, we've seen firsthand how termites exploit weaknesses like cold joints in concrete slabs to invade sheds, garages, and homes. Even steel-framed and block wall structures aren't immuneâ€”termites will attack any timber items inside.

**Termites Invading a Shed in Carindale: How We Stopped Them at the Source**

Are you worried about termites sneaking into your property? **Conquer Termites** recently discovered **active termites in a shed in Carindale**, where they were entering through a **cold joint** in the concrete slab. Our senior technician quickly identified the issue and recommended a targeted **termite treatment** to address the infestation.

### **How Termites Entered Through a Cold Joint**

A **cold joint** is where two concrete pours meet, creating a small gap that termites can exploit to gain access, in this case it was the gap created by the concrete slab pour against a block wall. The termites had built mud tubes through the joint and were spreading inside the shed's timber framing.

### **Treating the Termite Infestation**

To effectively manage the termite activity, we applied a professional-grade **termite treatment** with Termidor designed to reach deep into termite workings and address the infestation. This treatment ensures that termites unknowingly spread the product.

### **Termites Can Attack More Than Just Timber Homes**

A common myth is that termites wonâ€™t infest **steel-framed homes** or **block wall structures**, but the reality is different. Termites donâ€™t eat steel or concrete, but they will **find and consume any timber elements inside**â€”including flooring, skirting boards, roof trusses, and furniture. Just because a home isnâ€™t built entirely of timber doesnâ€™t mean itâ€™s safe from termites.



### **How to Prevent Termites from Entering Through Cold Joints**

While the immediate infestation was treated, long-term protection is key. We recommended applying a **termite management system** around the shed's perimeter to create a treated zone that stops termites from entering through cold joints or cracks in the concrete.
