Detecting termites can be challenging, especially when they invade concealed areas such as wall cavities, timber structures, or even trees. While traditional inspection methods provide valuable insights, advanced tools like borescope cameras have revolutionised the way termite activity is identified. These specialised cameras allow pest control professionals to see inside hidden spaces with minimal disruption, providing a clearer picture of potential infestations.

**How Borescope Cameras Work in Termite Inspections**

A borescope camera consists of a flexible probe with a high-resolution camera at the tip. It is designed to be inserted into small holes drilled into suspected infestation points, such as timber beams, walls, or tree trunks. The camera transmits real-time images or videos, enabling technicians to visually confirm termite activity without requiring extensive dismantling or structural damage. While drilling a small hole in plaster or timber is necessary, this method is far less invasive than removing entire wall linings or structural components.

**Real-World Example: Termites Found Inside a Tree**

Recently, one of our senior technicians used a borescope camera to inspect a tree in Brisbane’s south, after noticing external signs of termite activity. A small test hole was drilled into the base of the tree, allowing the camera to be inserted inside. The footage revealed a large number of termites actively moving within the tree, confirming the presence of a concealed nest. This precise detection method allowed for targeted treatment using Termidor, effectively eliminating the infestation while preserving the tree’s structure.

This case highlights the importance of using advanced technology to detect termite nests in unexpected places, ensuring a thorough and effective response to infestations.

**Why Borescope Cameras Improve Termite Detection**

Borescope cameras offer several advantages in termite inspections, including:

* **Minimally Invasive Inspection** – While a small hole must be drilled, this method is far less disruptive than removing sections of wall linings or timber structures.
* **Precision and Accuracy** – The high-resolution footage helps confirm the presence of termites and assess the extent of the infestation.
* **Early Detection in Hidden Areas** – Termites often remain undetected in concealed spaces. A borescope camera helps locate them before severe structural damage occurs.
* **Enhanced Decision-Making for Treatments** – By pinpointing exactly where termites are active, pest control professionals can apply treatments more effectively, reducing unnecessary chemical use.

**The Importance of Regular Termite Inspections**

Even with advanced tools like borescope cameras, regular termite inspections remain essential for protecting your property. Termites can invade both urban and rural properties, silently causing damage over time. Annual inspections help identify risk factors early and ensure that any infestations are treated before they lead to costly repairs.
