  Black Ants vs Termites: The Urban Myth That Could Cost You


  Many Gold Coast homeowners still believe black ants will keep termites away. But our recent findings tell a different story. We filmed ants and termites living side by side in the same garden stump—showing they can coexist without conflict.


  Inside the same home, termites had already made their way into the plasterboard and trims, only discovered during renovations.

There’s a persistent urban myth that still does the rounds in Brisbane and across the Gold Coast:\
**“If you’ve got black ants in the garden, you won’t have termites.”**

While ants and termites are natural enemies in some settings, this belief can be misleading—and costly. In reality, **ants and termites can often live side by side** without conflict, allowing termite activity to go unnoticed until serious damage is done.

## Real Footage: Ants and Termites in the Same Tree Stump

During a recent visit to a property, our team filmed something that completely debunks the myth.

Inside a garden stump, **black ants were nesting on one side, while termites were active just millimetres away** in the same timber. Both pests were using the stump—**coexisting without conflict or interference**.

This clearly shows that ants won’t necessarily drive termites away. If termites remain concealed and undisturbed, ants may never even know they’re there.

Yes, **if termites are suddenly exposed—by breaking open timber or disturbing their workings—ants may attack and feed on them**. But in most cases, termites stay hidden inside timbers, plaster, and wall cavities where ants don’t reach.

## Termites Found Inside the Home

The same property also revealed a more concerning discovery. During renovations, the homeowner uncovered **extensive termite damage**:

* Skirting boards and window trims had been attacked,
* Paint was lifted from the plasterboard, revealing **termites travelling beneath the surface**, and
* Internal wall linings had to be removed to assess the full extent of the infestation.

By the time termites are found like this, they’ve often been active for months, slowly working through timbers in complete silence.

## Don’t Let Myths Lead to Costly Repairs

The belief that ants will keep termites out can give homeowners a false sense of security.\
But ants don’t inspect slab edges, roof voids, or internal wall cavities. They’re not a substitute for **professional termite inspections or protective systems**.
