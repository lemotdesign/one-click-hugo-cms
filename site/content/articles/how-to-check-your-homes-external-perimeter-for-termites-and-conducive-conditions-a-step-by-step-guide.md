**How to Check Your Home's External Perimeter for Termites and Conducive Conditions: A Step-by-Step Guide**

While professional termite inspections are essential, homeowners can also regularly inspect their home’s perimeter for signs of termites and potential risks like moisture and fungal decay. Here’s how to conduct your own walk-around and reduce the chances of a termite infestation.

**1. Watch for Moisture Build-Up**

Moisture attracts termites and leads to fungal decay in timber. Look for these key areas during your inspection:

* Air Conditioning Units and Hot Water Systems: Ensure proper drainage to avoid water pooling near your home’s foundation.
* Overflow Relief Gullies (D Pots): Make sure these drainage systems are functioning properly, preventing water from accumulating near your house.
* Downpipes: Check for gaps behind downpipes, ensuring they allow water to drain away from the structure and that termites cannot use these as concealed entry points.

**2. Look for Structures That May Conceal Termite Activity**

External structures and personal items placed against the house can easily hide termite activity. Inspect the following:

* Decks and Patio Infill Cavities: Ensure a visible gap between timber decks and your house for easy inspection. These can be hot spots for termites if not properly maintained.
* Furniture, Built Structures, and Personal Items: Items such as outdoor furniture, sheds, or storage bins that are placed directly against the house can provide termites with concealed access, making detection more difficult.
* Garden Beds and Vegetation: Avoid having vegetation or garden beds directly against the home. This creates a damp environment ideal for termites and fungal decay.
* Water Tanks, Sheds, and Timber Gates: Make sure any structures abutting your home’s perimeter are adequately separated, leaving enough space for inspection and ventilation.

**3. Signs of Termite Activity**

Regularly check for visible signs of termites along the perimeter:

* Termite Mud Tunnels: Termites often build mud tunnels along walls or in corners as they move between the soil and their food source. These tunnels can be a clear indicator of termite presence.
* Soft or Damaged Wood: Press on areas of exposed timber or cladding. If the wood feels soft or gives way under pressure, it could indicate termite damage beneath the surface.

**4. Signs of Fungal Decay in Timber**

Fungal decay in timber often accompanies termite activity in moisture-prone areas:

* Discoloured or Soft Timber: Check for areas where wood appears darker or soft to the touch, especially on window frames or timber cladding.
* Fungal Decay: If you notice fungal decay, it’s a clear indicator of excess moisture, which makes timber more vulnerable to termites.

**5. Concealed Termite Entry Points**

Even with regular checks, termites can enter through concealed gaps, especially:

* Nominal Gaps Behind Structures: Ensure gaps around downpipes, decks, and water tanks allow for easy inspection.
* Vegetation Touching the Structure: Trim back plants or garden beds to prevent termites from bridging across to your home.
* Weep holes or through cracks in the concrete slab
* Termite Shield ( Ant Caps ) that are damaged or rusted
* Overpass or bridge over termite sheeting material installed at time of construction
* Plumbing penetrations through kitchens, laundry and bathroom areas

Professional termite inspections are essential and recommended at least once a year, even if there is a termite management system in place. These inspections provide a thorough assessment of your property and help identify any hidden risks.
