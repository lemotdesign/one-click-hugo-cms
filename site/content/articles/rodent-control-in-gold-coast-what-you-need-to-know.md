As we head into the cooler winter months, rodents like rats and mice start looking for warm, sheltered places to nest—and your home is the perfect spot. If you’ve started hearing scratching in the ceiling or noticed droppings in the pantry, you’re not alone.

Rats and mice may be small, but they can cause big problems in Brisbane and Gold Coast homes—especially as the weather starts to cool and they look for warm places to nest. At Conquer Termites, we often get questions from homeowners who think they might have a rodent problem but aren’t quite sure what to look for or what to expect from a treatment. So, let’s break it down.

### **Signs You Might Have Rodents in Your Home**

Not sure if rats or mice have moved in? Here are some common tell-tale signs:

* **Scratching or scurrying sounds** in the roof void, particularly at night.
* **Droppings**, often found in kitchen cupboards, pantries, or along skirting boards.
* **Greasy rub marks** along walls and pipes where rodents travel the same route.
* **Chewed packaging or wiring**, which can even become a fire hazard.
* **Unusual pet behaviour** – dogs and cats may become fixated on certain walls or areas.

### **What If a Rat Dies in the Roof?**

This is a question we get *all the time*—and for good reason. No one wants to deal with a bad smell hanging around.

Here’s the good news: in most cases, rats feel unwell and instinctively seek water, which usually leads them outside before they die. It’s quite rare for one to pass away in the roof void. Even if it does happen, the heat in the roof space helps the smell dissipate quickly. Any odour usually fades within a few days and is rarely as bad as many people expect.

### **Is Rodent Baiting Safe?**

Absolutely – when done correctly. At Conquer Termites, we use targeted and secure rodenticide baiting stations that are **safe, effective**, and **professionally placed** out of reach of children and pets. These baits are designed to be attractive to rodents but remain locked away inside tamper-resistant stations.

We carefully inspect your home to locate activity zones—typically the roof void and around the subfloor (if you have one)—and then strategically place baits in these areas. Our aim is to reduce the population quickly and safely, with minimal impact on your home life.

### **How Long Does It Take to Work?**

Rodent baiting is very effective, but it’s not instant. Most homeowners will start to notice a drop in activity within **5 to 10 days**. If needed, we’ll return to check on bait levels and top them up if necessary.

### **What Can I Do to Help?**

Here are a few tips to make your home less attractive to rodents:

* Don’t leave pet food out overnight.
* Keep rubbish bins sealed.
* Trim tree branches away from your roof.
* Seal gaps around plumbing or vents.
