title: "Termites Found in Brick Home in Carina: How They Travelled from Garage
  to Roof Void"

description: >-
  At Conquer Termites, we recently uncovered a serious termite infestation in a
  brick home in Carina, Brisbane. Termites had entered through the garage
  brickwork and travelled all the way to the roof void. The home hadnâ€™t had a
  termite inspection in years and had no protection in place â€” a situation we
  unfortunately come across all too often.


  Brick veneer homes on slab foundations, which are common across the Gold Coast, are not immune. Termites only need a tiny gap to enter and can remain hidden until major damage is done.


  If you live on the Gold Coast and havenâ€™t had a recent inspection, this story is a reminder of how easily termites can invade â€” and how far they can travel.

**Termite Infestation in Carina: From Garage Brickwork to the Roof Void**

A recent termite discovery in Carina, Brisbane, serves as a stark reminder of just how far termites can go when left unchecked. Our team was called to inspect a property where termites had entered through the brickwork in the garage â€“ and by the time we arrived, they had already made their way up into the roof void.

### No Inspection. No Protection. Big Trouble.

The homeowner admitted they hadnâ€™t had a termite inspection in many years and unfortunately didnâ€™t have any termite protection in place. Without regular checks or a treatment system around the home, termites had free rein to move undetected through concealed areas.

At this Carina home, termites used the mortar joints and small gaps in the brickwork to enter the structure at ground level. From there, they travelled internally behind the walls and made their way all the way to the top â€“ causing damage along the way.

### The Hidden Vulnerabilities of Brick Homes on Slab

Brick veneer homes built on a slab-on-ground construction are very common across Brisbane suburbs like Carina. While they may look solid, termites only need a tiny gap â€” as little as 1â€“2 mm â€” to enter undetected.

Some of the vulnerabilities include:

* **Concealed slab edges**: If the slab edge is not fully visible due to rendered walls, garden beds, or pathways, it becomes harder to inspect and easier for termites to enter without being noticed.
* **Mortar joints and weep holes**: Termites often use gaps in brick mortar or weep holes as entry points.
* **Poor drainage or moisture buildup**: Moist soil near the slab creates an inviting environment for termites to nest and forage.

Termites are masters at travelling behind walls and through concealed spaces â€” meaning they can cause significant damage before any visible signs appear.

### The Importance of Regular Termite Inspections

Regular termite inspections â€“ at least once a year â€“ are essential for detecting early signs of termite activity before serious damage occurs. In this case, if an inspection had been carried out earlier, the infestation could have been caught well before it reached the roof void.

### Protecting Your Home from Termites

At Conquer Termites, weâ€™ve seen how quickly termites can compromise a home when thereâ€™s no protection in place. We recommend:

* **Annual termite inspections** to monitor for signs of activity
