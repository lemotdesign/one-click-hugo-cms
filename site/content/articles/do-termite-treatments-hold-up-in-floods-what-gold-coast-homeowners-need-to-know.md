**How Do Termite Treatments Hold Up During Floods?**

With Tropical Cyclone Alfred approaching Brisbane and the Gold Coast, homeowners are preparing for potential heavy rainfall, strong winds, and flooding. One concern that often arises during severe weather is whether termite treatments remain effective after a flood event.

### Does Flooding Impact Termite Treatments?

BASF’s Termidor, a leading termiticide, is well known for its ability to bond strongly with soil, minimizing the risk of leaching. However, while Termidor itself does not wash away under normal conditions, floodwaters and debris can disturb treated zones, potentially compromising the termite management system.

### What is a Disturbed Termite Management System?

A "disturbed termite management system" refers to any disruption in the treated soil barrier that reduces its ability to protect against termites. This can happen if floodwaters shift soil, wash away treated areas, or if debris settles over the treated zone, creating pathways that allow termites to bypass the protection.

### What Should Homeowners Do After Flooding?

If your home has been affected by flooding, it is recommended to:

* Inspect the perimeter of your home for signs of soil movement or debris accumulation.
* Contact a professional termite specialist to assess whether the treated zone has been compromised.
* Schedule a termite inspection to ensure your home remains protected.

### The Importance of Ongoing Termite Protection

Even after extreme weather events, termites remain a persistent threat. Ensuring your termite treatment is intact is crucial for long-term home protection. If you suspect your treatment may have been disturbed by recent flooding, reach out to Conquer Termites for an expert assessment and guidance on maintaining your home’s defense against termites.
