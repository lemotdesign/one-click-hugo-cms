Termites are among the most destructive pests that homeowners can encounter. These small insects cause significant damage to wooden structures, often before the damage is even noticed. One of the most common questions homeowners have is: What types of timber do termites eat? In this article, we'll explore the types of timber and other materials that termites are likely to target, including floorboards, timber laminate, cardboard, and paper. Understanding termite behaviour is essential for preventing infestations and protecting your home.

### What Are Termites?

Termites are tiny insects that feed on cellulose, a fibrous material found in plant matter. While wood is their primary food source, termites can also consume a wide range of materials that contain cellulose. This includes timber products, cardboard, paper, and even some types of insulation. Termites are known as “silent destroyers” because they often go undetected for months, causing significant damage to timber structures before they are noticed. Understanding their feeding habits is crucial for homeowners looking to prevent damage.

### Types of Timber Termites Will Eat

#### 1. Softwood Timbers

Softwoods such as pine, cedar, and fir are particularly vulnerable to termite infestations. These timbers are commonly used in the framing of homes, roof beams, and furniture. Their soft, porous structure, combined with a high cellulose content, makes them an easy target for termites looking for a food source.

#### 2. Hardwood Timbers

Hardwoods like oak, mahogany, and teak are more resistant to termites than softwoods, but they are not immune. Termites may still target hardwood timbers, especially if they are damaged or exposed to moisture. While hardwoods are denser and harder, they still provide a food source for termites if no other option is available.

#### 3. Floorboards and Wooden Flooring

Timber floorboards are one of the most common targets for termites. Older homes with wooden flooring are at high risk of termite infestations, particularly if the timber has been exposed to moisture or is in contact with the ground. Termites can burrow into floorboards and weaken the timber from the inside out. Regular inspections of your timber floors are crucial for identifying early signs of termite activity.

#### 4. Timber Laminate and MDF (Medium Density Fibreboard)

Although timber laminate and MDF are engineered products, they still contain cellulose and can be susceptible to termite damage. These materials are commonly used in interior finishes, including flooring, cabinetry, and furniture. While they may offer more resistance to termites than solid timber, they can still be damaged if termites gain access to the layers beneath the surface.

#### 5. Timber Decking and External Structures

Timber decking, pergolas, and other external wooden structures are highly susceptible to termite damage, especially in areas where moisture is present. The combination of timber and exposure to the elements makes these areas a prime target for termites. Wooden posts and beams in direct contact with the soil are at a particularly high risk of infestation.

### Not Just Timber: Other Materials Termites Eat

Termites are not picky eaters. In addition to timber, they will consume any material that contains cellulose, including:

* Cardboard: Cardboard packaging or old boxes often attract termites, particularly when stored near timber structures.
* Paper: Newspapers, office documents, books, and other paper products can provide a food source for termites if they are kept in humid conditions.
* Insulation: Certain types of insulation materials, such as cellulose-based options, can attract termites, especially if exposed to moisture or in contact with timber.

### How Do Termites Feed on Timber?

Termites feed by tunnelling into timber and consuming the cellulose from the inside out. The process is often hidden from view, with termites travelling through the timber’s interior and leaving behind little evidence of their activity. The process involves two main stages:

1. Feeding: Worker termites consume the cellulose within the timber, breaking it down into nourishment. This weakens the structure, making it vulnerable to further damage.
2. Tunnelling: As termites feed, they create a complex network of tunnels within the wood. These tunnels are often concealed, making it difficult to detect an infestation until the damage is extensive.

### Signs of Termite Damage to Timber

If termites are active in your home, there are several signs to watch for:

* Hollow Sounding Timber: When you tap on wooden surfaces, such as floorboards or beams, you may hear a hollow sound. This could be a sign that termites have burrowed into the timber and consumed it from the inside out.
* Mud Tubes: Termites build mud tubes along the surface of timber to protect themselves from predators and to maintain moisture. If you spot mud tubes along wooden structures or on external surfaces, it’s a clear indication of termite activity.
* Sawdust Piles: Termites leave behind frass, a sawdust-like material that accumulates near areas of damage. If you find this around your furniture or floorboards, termites could be present.
* Cracked or Warped Wood: As termites feed, they weaken the timber, causing it to crack, warp, or buckle. If your wooden floors or beams begin to show these signs, it may be a result of termite damage.

### Protecting Your Home from Termite Damage

Given the variety of materials that termites can feed on, it's essential to take proactive steps to protect your home from these destructive pests. Here are some key strategies to help prevent termite infestations:

* Regular Inspections: Schedule regular termite inspections with a professional pest control service. Termites are often difficult to detect early, and a professional inspection can identify issues before they escalate into serious damage.
* Moisture Control: Termites thrive in damp conditions. Ensure that there is proper drainage around your home, repair any plumbing leaks, and keep your foundation dry. This makes your home less appealing to termites.
* Termite Barriers and Treatments: Consider installing termite barriers around your property and applying termite treatments to your timber. These preventative measures can help protect your home from infestations.
* Seal Gaps and Cracks: Seal any gaps, cracks, or holes in the structure of your home to prevent termites from entering.
* Use Termite-Resistant Materials: If you're building or renovating, consider using termite-resistant timber or materials where possible. This can provide added protection against potential infestations.
