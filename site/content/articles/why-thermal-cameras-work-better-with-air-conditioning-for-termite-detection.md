  Termite inspections just got smarter on the Gold Coast! At Conquer Termites,
  we harness the power of thermal imaging to detect hidden termite activity in
  your home. Did you know that turning on your air conditioning before an
  inspection enhances the clarity of thermal images? This clever trick sharpens
  heat contrast, making it easier to identify termites before they cause major
  damage.

Thermal imaging technology has revolutionised termite detection, allowing pest control professionals to identify temperature anomalies that may indicate termite activity. However, did you know that turning on your air conditioning can enhance the accuracy and clarity of thermal images? Here, we explain why this practice produces a better contrast for detecting termites and why itâ€™s essential to optimise conditions during an inspection.

### **How Thermal Cameras Detect Termites**

Thermal cameras work by capturing infrared radiation, which translates into a heat map of the area being inspected. Termites generate heat as part of their metabolic activity, and their movements through timbers or walls can create noticeable temperature anomalies. These anomalies often appear as warmer areas compared to the surrounding environment, helping pest technicians pinpoint termite activity.

### **The Role of Air Conditioning in Thermal Imaging**

The effectiveness of thermal cameras is significantly influenced by the temperature contrast within the inspected area. Turning on the air conditioning creates a cooler indoor environment, which enhances the contrast between the termite activity (warm spots) and the surrounding structure. Hereâ€™s why this works:

* **Improved Heat Differentiation:** Air conditioning cools down walls, ceilings, and timbers. When termites are present, their heat signature becomes more apparent against the cooler surfaces, making it easier to spot them on the thermal camera.
* **Sharper Thermal Images:** The cooler environment provided by air conditioning creates a crisper image by amplifying the differences between normal and abnormal heat signatures. This ensures more precise identification of termite activity.
* **Reduced Environmental Interference:** Without air conditioning, the natural temperature fluctuations in a home can cause inconsistencies in thermal readings. By stabilising the indoor temperature, air conditioning eliminates these variables, allowing for more reliable detection.

### **Why Optimised Thermal Imaging Matters**

Using a thermal camera under the right conditions is crucial for accurate termite detection. Poor contrast or unclear images can lead to missed signs of activity, potentially allowing termites to continue causing damage undetected. Ensuring a controlled environment, such as running the air conditioning, helps pest control professionals deliver a thorough and precise inspection.

Additionally, thermal imaging is non-invasive and safe, making it an excellent tool for assessing potential termite infestations without disrupting your home. Combined with expert techniques, it allows for effective identification and targeted treatment, saving homeowners from extensive damage and costly repairs.
