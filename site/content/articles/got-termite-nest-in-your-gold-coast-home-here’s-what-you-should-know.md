#### Types of Termite Nests and Where They Might Be Hiding:



1. **Arboreal Nests in Trees** - **Where to Look:** Roof voids
2. **Mound Nests on Soil** - **Where to Look:** Subfloors or underneath the house
3. **Trunk Nests Inside Tree Trunks** - **Where to Look:** Inside wall cavities

#### Should You Try to Remove a Termite Nest?

Trying to remove a termite nest on your own is not a great idea. It might seem tempting, but messing with it can just spread the infestation further in your Gold Coast home. It’s way smarter to call in a pest control expert who can take a proper look and come up with a solid treatment plan for your specific situation.

#### Is Spraying a Termite Nest a Good Idea?

Spraying a termite nest with insecticide usually doesn’t do much and can even be risky. Most sprays don’t reach deep enough to get the queen and the rest of the colony. Plus, spraying can just make the termites scatter and invade new areas of your home. Instead, professionals have special treatments designed to target the whole colony more effectively.

#### Should You Break Those Termite Tunnels?

Breaking termite tunnels, or mud tubes, isn’t recommended unless you’re working with a pest control pro. While it might seem like a good way to scare them off, it can actually make them move and create new tunnels somewhere else, which just makes the problem worse. Let the experts assess how bad the infestation is and decide on the best plan without causing more damage.

#### How Far Can Termites Travel from Their Nest?

Termites can travel quite a distance from their nest when they’re searching for food and moisture. For example, subterranean termites can wander up to 50 meters away from their nest!
