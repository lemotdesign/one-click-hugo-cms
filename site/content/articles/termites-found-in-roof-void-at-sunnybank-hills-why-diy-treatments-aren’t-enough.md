  Arenâ€™t Enough"

description: Not all termites are the sameâ€”and on the Gold Coast, some of the
  most destructive species belong to the Coptotermes group. These termites are
  responsible for significant structural damage across the region, often going
  undetected until itâ€™s too late. Whether itâ€™s a large nest hidden in a tree,
  moisture-damaged wall cavities, or activity in the roof void, Coptotermes
  species like acinaciformis, lacteus, and frenchi pose a serious threat to
  local homes. Knowing the signsâ€”and acting earlyâ€”is key to protecting your
  property.

## **Termites Found in Roof Void at Sunnybank Hills: Why DIY Treatments Arenâ€™t Enough**

A recent termite case in Sunnybank Hills highlights the risks of relying on DIY termite control products. The homeowner initially attempted to manage a suspected termite issue by using over-the-counter bait and applying a repellent spray. Unfortunately, these methods only delayed the problem, allowing termites to remain activeâ€”this time in the roof void.

### **DIY Termite Treatment Failed to Stop the Infestation**

When the homeowner noticed signs of termites, they tried to treat the area themselves. While their efforts did result in some dead termites being found later, this wasnâ€™t enough to address the root of the problem. By the time Conquer Termites was called in, live termites were still active within the roof void, causing further damage.

### **Our Inspection Revealed More Than Expected**

Our senior technician carried out a thorough termite inspection using advanced tools including a **thermal imaging camera** and **moisture meter**. Temperature anomalies and high moisture readings were clear indicators of hidden termite activity. Further investigation confirmed live termitesâ€”identified as *Coptotermes*, a destructive species known for their ability to silently damage structural timber.

### **Why *Coptotermes* Are Challenging to Treat**

*Coptotermes* are one of the most aggressive and destructive termite species in Australia. They operate from a single central nest and are known to **seal off or isolate parts of the colony** when they sense dangerâ€”especially when exposed to repellent chemicals or disturbed by DIY products. This behaviour makes them particularly tricky to eliminate unless the correct treatment strategy is used.

### **Targeted Above-Ground Baiting in the Roof Void**

After locating the area where the termites were feeding on a timber joist, we installed an **above-ground termite bait station** directly in the roof void. This type of station allows us to **target the active termites without repelling them**, encouraging them to feed on the bait and take it back to the nest. Over time, this bait will be spread through the colony, leading to total elimination.

### **The Next Step: A Termite Management System for Long-Term Protection**

Once the active infestation is under control, we will return to **install a full termite management system** around the external foundations of the home. This treatment will create a treated zone that prevents future termite entry and gives the homeowner long-term peace of mind.

### **What Homeowners Can Learn from This Case**

* **DIY termite treatments can fail** and even make things worse by scattering termites or causing them to retreat deeper into inaccessible areas.
* **Professional inspections using thermal and moisture tools** are essential to detect activity in hidden spaces like roof voids.
* **Above-ground baiting is a safe and effective way** to treat internal termite activity without disturbing the colony too early.
* **A complete termite management system is vital** for long-term protection, especially in termite-prone suburbs like Sunnybank Hills.
