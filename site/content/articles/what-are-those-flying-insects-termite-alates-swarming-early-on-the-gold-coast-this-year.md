Gold Coast homeowners, take note: the flying insects you’re seeing could be **termite alates**, the winged reproductives of termites. While they typically swarm from **October to March**, the early arrival of warm weather this year has triggered swarming as early as **September**. Alates fly out from mature colonies to establish new nests, posing a serious risk to homes.

**Why Are They Swarming Earlier This Year?**

The early appearance of alates is unusual but not unexpected, given the warmer conditions South East Queensland has experienced this year. Termites are highly sensitive to environmental changes, and warmer-than-average temperatures accelerate their reproductive cycles. The moisture and warmth create the perfect environment for swarming, as alates search for new places to settle and start colonies.

**Identifying Termite Alates vs Other Insects**

Alates are often mistaken for flying ants or other harmless insects. However, **termite alates** have distinct characteristics:

* **Straight antennae**
* **Equal-length wings** (two sets of wings)
* **Thick, straight waist** If you spot these insects in or around your home, it’s likely that termite activity is nearby, potentially leading to infestations.

**Why You Should Be Concerned**

A swarm of alates near your home is a red flag that a mature colony is active close by. This could spell danger for your property’s structural integrity. Unlike other pests, termites work silently, often causing extensive damage before you even realize they’re present. Spotting swarming alates early gives homeowners a crucial opportunity to act before the problem worsens.

**Steps to Take If You Spot Alates**

1. **Check your home** for signs of termites, including mud tubes along walls, damaged or hollow-sounding wood, and discarded wings near windows or doors.
2. **Check for high humidity areas** around your property, as these can attract termites.
