title: Is Treated Timber Enough to Stop Termites on the Gold Coast?

description: The Gold Coast’s warm climate and leafy surrounds create the
  perfect environment for termites — even in homes built with treated timber.
  While treated timber adds important protection against termites, it isn’t fool
  proof. If not installed or maintained correctly, termites can still find a way
  in. In this article, we break down what treated timber actually does, what H2,
  H3 and H4 ratings mean, and why termite inspections are still essential for
  protecting your Gold Coast home.

Living on the Gold Coast means sun, surf — and unfortunately, a high risk of termites. If you're building or renovating, you’ve likely asked: **Does treated timber really stop termites?** The answer is — it helps significantly, but only when used properly.

### What Is Treated Timber?

Treated timber is timber that’s been infused with protective chemicals to guard against:

* Termite attack
* Borer activity
* Fungal decay
* Rot and moisture damage

It’s widely used across homes on the Gold Coast for everything from framing and decks to garden walls and outdoor features.

### Understanding Timber Treatment Ratings: H2, H3 & H4

Timber in Australia is treated to specific Hazard Levels (H-levels) that determine where it can safely be used:

#### **H2 – Inside, Dry Areas**

* **Use**: Internal framing, roof voids, trusses.
* **Protection**: Only protects against **termites**, not moisture or decay.
* **Treatment**: Often with **permethrin** or **bifenthrin**.
* **Note**: Suitable only for dry, enclosed internal areas.

#### **H3 – Outdoor Use Above Ground**

* **Use**: Pergolas, cladding, balcony rails — timber exposed to weather but not touching soil.
* **Protection**: Guards against **termites, fungi, and decay**.
* **Treatment**: Includes **LOSP**, **copper azole**, and **ACQ**.
* **Note**: Requires good ventilation and runoff. Can fail if timber remains damp.

#### **H4 – In-Ground Contact**

* **Use**: Retaining walls, landscaping timbers, fence posts.
* **Protection**: Designed for **direct soil contact**, resisting decay and termites.
* **Treatment**: Typically **CCA** or **ACQ**, both strong copper-based preservatives.
* **Note**: Must be correctly installed with drainage to avoid long-term saturation.

### ⚠️ Where Treated Timber Can Fail

Even if your timber is treated, it’s **not invincible** — we see this often on the Gold Coast. Common problems include:

* **Unsealed off-cuts** or saw cuts exposing untreated core.
* **Drilled holes** not sealed after electrical or plumbing installations.
* **Wrong rating** used for the job — such as using H3 timber underground instead of H4.
* **Timber buried in soil** without proper clearance or protection.

> 🛠️ If you trim or drill into treated timber, always **seal the exposed surfaces** with an approved preservative to prevent termite entry.
