**Ant Infestations in Gold Coast: Signs and Solutions for Homeowners**

As the Gold Coast transitions into the warmer months of spring and summer, ants become increasingly active, making it more likely that homeowners will encounter these persistent pests. Recognizing the signs of an ant infestation early on can help you take action before the problem escalates. At Conquer Termites, we offer expert pest control solutions to keep your home ant-free as temperatures rise.

**Common Signs of an Ant Infestation**

1. **Visible Ant Trails**\
   One of the clearest signs of an infestation is spotting ants forming visible trails across your floors, walls, or outdoor areas. Ants leave behind scent trails that help others from their colony follow them to food sources, resulting in these long lines of ants.
2. **Nests in the Garden or Walls**\
   Ants typically nest in hidden areas, such as behind walls, under garden rocks, or within pavers. Look for small piles of dirt or sawdust near skirting boards or outdoor areas, which could indicate a nearby nest.
3. **Discarded Wings**\
   Winged ants appear during mating season. If you find tiny discarded wings near windowsills or doorways, it’s a sign that ants are establishing new colonies on your property.
4. **Ants in Food Storage Areas**\
   Ants frequently target kitchens, pantries, and food storage areas. If you notice them around food containers or countertops, it's a strong indication that they’ve entered your home.
5. **Wood Damage**\
   While not as destructive as termites, carpenter ants can cause damage to wooden structures. If you see small holes or tunnels in wood around your home, further investigation is warranted.

**Why Ants Are More Active in Spring and Summer**

Warmer weather encourages ants to forage more actively, especially as their colonies expand. As spring and summer temperatures rise in the Gold Coast, ants seek both food and shelter inside homes, increasing the likelihood of infestations. Addressing these issues promptly is critical to preventing large colonies from becoming established in your home.

**How Conquer Termites Can Help**

At Conquer Termites, we offer a complete range of ant control solutions tailored to the Gold Coast conditions and ant species. Our targeted approach includes:

* **Thorough Inspection**\
  We begin by conducting a detailed inspection of your property to identify the ant species, locate nests, and assess the extent of the infestation.
* **Targeted Treatments**\
  Our ant control treatments are specifically designed to target and eliminate ants at their entry points and nesting sites. We use gel bait in areas where ants enter the home, effectively disrupting their trails and controlling the colony. For comprehensive coverage, we apply an internal and external spray around your property. Additionally, we provide a roof void dusting using a blower, ensuring that ants in hidden spaces are dealt with thoroughly.
* **Tailored Solutions for Long-Term Protection**\
  After resolving the immediate infestation, we focus on providing tailored advice on how to prevent ants from returning. Sealing entry points, keeping food storage areas clean, and minimizing moisture are some of the ways to ensure your home remains protected as the seasons change.
