**Fire Ants in Brisbane and the Gold Coast: What You Need to Know**

Fire ants are a significant invasive pest in Australia, first detected in Brisbane in 2001. They have since become a major concern for residents in Brisbane and the Gold Coast due to their aggressive behaviour, painful stings, and potential to harm local ecosystems and agriculture.

This article explains how to identify fire ants, understand their impact, and know the next steps if you suspect an infestation on your property.

**What Are Fire Ants?**

Fire ants are small, reddish-brown insects with darker abdomens. Measuring 2–6 mm in size, these ants vary in size within a single nest. Their colonies form dome-shaped mounds or appear as disturbed soil without visible entry or exit holes, as fire ants use underground tunnels to move in and out.

These ants are known for their painful stings, which can cause allergic reactions in some individuals. Beyond human discomfort, fire ants threaten native wildlife, crops, and livestock, making their eradication a national priority.

**Identifying Fire Ants**

Fire ants are small, reddish-brown insects with these distinct features:

* **Size**: Varies between 2–6 mm within the same colony.
* **Colour**: Copper-brown with a darker abdomen.
* **Nest Appearance**: Their nests often look like dome-shaped mounds or disturbed soil without visible entry or exit holes, as they use underground tunnels.
* **Behaviour**: Fire ants swarm aggressively when disturbed, delivering painful stings.

You might find fire ants near lawns, garden beds, fence lines, or under objects like timber and rocks. If you notice these signs, it's essential to act promptly.
