Firewood is a convenient fuel source, but storing it incorrectly can **attract termites** and put your home at risk. During a recent termite inspection, our technicians discovered **live termites actively feeding on firewood inside a shed**. The homeowner had no idea they were thereâ€”until they moved some stored items and uncovered **termites eating through the stacked timber**.

Many homeowners donâ€™t realise that a **termite infestation in a shed** can quickly spread to the main house. If timber is in direct contact with the ground or stacked against a structure, termites can **move from the shed to your home**, causing costly damage.

## **How Termites Entered the Shed Through a Cold Joint**

In this case, termites gained access through a **cold joint in the concrete slab**â€”a small gap where two concrete pours meet. These gaps provide an easy entry point for termites, allowing them to build **mud tubes** into the shed and reach the stored firewood.

Because the shed was used for storage, **the termite activity remained hidden**. The homeowner only discovered the infestation when they **moved stored items** and found termites consuming the firewood.

### **Why This Matters for Homeowners**

Termites donâ€™t stop at firewoodâ€”**if theyâ€™re in your shed, they could be in your home next**. Even if you have a steel-framed house, termites will still target timber flooring, skirting boards, roof trusses, and furniture. Thatâ€™s why **proper firewood storage and regular inspections** are essential.

## **How to Prevent Termites in Sheds and Firewood Storage**

Protect your shed and home from termite infestations by following these steps:

### âœ… **Store Firewood Off the Ground**

Firewood stacked directly on the ground is an open invitation for termites. Instead, store it on a **metal stand, treated timber supports, or concrete blocks** to **keep it at least 20â€“30cm above the soil**.

### âœ… **Keep Firewood Away from Your House and Shed**

Stacking firewood **against a wall, fence, or structure** can allow termites to **spread undetected**. Keep firewood **at least 5 metres away from your home and shed** to reduce the risk.

### âœ… **Rotate and Use Firewood Regularly**

Termites prefer **undisturbed timber**, so avoid leaving firewood in place for long periods. **Use older logs first** and regularly move stacks to check for signs of activity.

### âœ… **Check for Termite Signs Regularly**

Look for **mud tubes, hollow timber, or live termites** in and around your firewood. In this case, termites **came up through the cold joint** and built mud tubes along the stacked timber. **If you see termites, do not disturb themâ€”call a professional immediately.**

### âœ… **Schedule a Professional Termite Inspection**

Even if you donâ€™t see termites, **a trained technician can detect early signs of an infestation** before major damage occurs. Regular inspections are key to **protecting your home** from costly termite problems.
