As we welcome the New Year 2025, it's the perfect time to ensure your home is safeguarded against termites. In Brisbane and the Gold Coast, termite treatment costs can vary depending on several factors, including the size of your property, the extent of the infestation, and the type of treatment required. Here’s a breakdown to help you budget:

#### **1. Termite Inspection Costs**

A professional termite inspection typically ranges from **$300 to $600**, depending on the size and layout of your home. Inspections are essential for identifying active termites, vulnerable areas, and potential risks.

#### **2. Chemical Termite Treatments**

If termites are discovered, chemical treatments are often the first line of defence. Prices generally range from **$3000 to $6,000**, depending on:

* The type of chemical used.
* Whether the treatment is applied as a perimeter treatment or spot application.
* The size of the property and treated areas.

#### **3. Termite Baiting Systems**

For ongoing protection, baiting systems are a popular choice. These systems involve installing bait stations around your property and monitoring them regularly. Initial installation costs typically start at **$2,000**, with annual servicing fees ranging from **$700 to $1,000**.

#### **4. Repairs to Termite Damage**

If termites have caused damage, repair costs can vary significantly. Minor repairs, like fixing damaged door frames, may cost a few hundred dollars, while extensive structural repairs can run into the thousands.

#### **5. Preventative Treatments**

For homes without active termites, preventative treatments provide peace of mind. Options like chemical treatments or physical protection during renovations generally range between **$1,500 and $3,500**, depending on your needs.
