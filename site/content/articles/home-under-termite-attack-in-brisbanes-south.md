  Is Your Gold Coast Home Safe from Termites?


  Termites are a constant threat in the Gold Coast's warm climate, as demonstrated by a recent large-scale infestation in Sunnybank on Brisbane's South. At Conquer Termites, weâ€™ve seen how quickly termites can invade homes, even bypassing management systems to cause significant damage.


  From active termites spreading through a shed and subfloor to a hidden nest discovered inside a tree, this case highlights why no home is completely termite-proof. Regular inspections by professionals are crucial for early detection and effective treatment, preventing costly repairs and protecting your biggest asset.

**Sunnybank Home Overrun by Termites: A Stark Reminder for Annual Inspections**

Termites can infiltrate even the most well-maintained homes, as evidenced by a severe infestation recently uncovered by one of our senior technicians, Ben, in Sunnybank, located in Brisbaneâ€™s south. This alarming case demonstrates why annual inspections are essential, even for homes with termite management systems in place.

### **The Scale of the Infestation**

During the inspection, Ben found active termite activity across multiple areas of the property. In the shed, termites exploited weaknesses and gaps around the concrete slab to gain access, eventually spreading to adjoining structures. Inside the home, termites had made their way into the subfloor, damaging the trim timbers around doors and windowsâ€”a common target for these destructive pests.

The infestation extended outdoors to a nearby tree, where Ben suspected a hidden termite nest. Using a test drilling technique, he confirmed the presence of a nest at the tree's base. To investigate further, he employed a borescope camera, which revealed a thriving termite population within the tree.

### **Eradicating the Termite Infestation**

To address the issue and protect the property, Ben applied **Termidor**, a state-of-the-art non-repellent termiticide known for its superior colony-elimination capabilities. This highly effective treatment not only controlled the infestation but also provided long-lasting protection, offering the homeowner peace of mind.

### **No Such Thing as a Termite-Proof Home**

This case serves as a sobering reminder that no property is entirely immune to termites. Termite management systems are a crucial line of defence, but they cannot provide 100% protection. Regular inspections are indispensable for identifying termite activity early and mitigating potential damage. An annual inspection by a professional can save homeowners from costly repairs and irreversible damage to their biggest asset.
