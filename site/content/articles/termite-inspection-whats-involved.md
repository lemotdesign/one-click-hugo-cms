**Comprehensive Termite Inspections for Brisbane and Gold Coast Homes**

At Conquer Termites, we understand that protecting your home from termites is crucial. Our team of trained, insured, and highly experienced termite inspectors is committed to providing thorough and reliable inspections. From the moment we drive up to your home, our experts are already assessing the area, taking note of local conditions and features that may make your property more conducive to termite activity.

### Exterior Inspection

Our process begins outside your home. We meticulously inspect:

* **Exterior walls** for signs of damage or mud tubes.
* **The perimeter and gardens** for potential termite entry points or nesting sites.
* **Fences and other structures** in contact with the ground, as these can be common pathways for termites.

By starting with the exterior, we gain a comprehensive understanding of any vulnerabilities before moving inside.

### Interior Inspection

Inside your home, our termite inspectors use advanced tools and techniques to detect termite activity, including:

* **Sounding devices** to tap exposed timbers and identify hollow areas, a tell-tale sign of termite damage.
* **Thermal imaging cameras** to detect temperature anomalies within walls that may indicate termite activity.

* **Moisture meters** to identify areas with elevated moisture levels, which termites are drawn to.

* **Termatrac devices** to detect movement of termites inside walls.

* **Borescopes**, when necessary, to visually confirm termite presence within cavities or concealed areas.

We ensure every exposed timber, from door frames to window frames, is carefully checked to provide a comprehensive inspection.

### Roof Voids and Subfloors

If your home includes roof voids or subfloors, our inspectors will thoroughly examine these areas. These hidden spaces are often overlooked but can be prime spots for termite activity. By carefully inspecting these locations, we leave no stone unturned in protecting your property.

### Property History and Current Protection

As part of our inspection, we take note of the property’s history and whether it is currently protected with a termite management system. This includes identifying whether there are bait systems, chemical treatments, or physical management systems in place. If no termite management system is present, we are more than happy to provide a free quote and assess the house for associated risks of concealed termite entry.

### Addressing Conducive Conditions and Limitations

Guided by the Australian Standards and Building Code, we also check for any conducive conditions that may increase the risk of termite attack, such as:

* **Fungal decay**
* **Moisture issues**

Additionally, we take note of limitations, such as attachments on walls or areas where inspection is restricted. All these observations are communicated to the homeowner, as our priority is to keep your property safe while maintaining honesty, reliability, and professionalism.
