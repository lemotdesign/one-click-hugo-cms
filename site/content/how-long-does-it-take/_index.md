      At Conquer, we stand by the belief that quality takes precedence over
      haste. 


      Effective pest control is not just a matter of treatment but also about understanding and addressing your specific concerns. That's why we dedicate a generous amount of time for your pest treatment:


      ### **Time Allocation Based on Home Size:**


      * **Large Homes:** Approximately **1 & 1/2 to 2 hours** are allocated to ensure all areas are comprehensively treated.

      * **Average-Sized Homes**: We spend over **1 & 1/2 hours** treating standard homes, covering all necessary aspects.

      * **Smaller Homes or Apartments**: **A full hour** is dedicated even to the smallest properties, ensuring Conquer's high standards are met.
