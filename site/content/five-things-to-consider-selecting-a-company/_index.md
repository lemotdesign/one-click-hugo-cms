      When you're reaching out to pest control companies on the Gold Coast,
      having a specific set of questions can help you make an informed decision.
      Here's a checklist based on your requirements:


      1. **Local Presence**: Ask if the company is genuinely local to the Gold Coast. This is important to ensure quick and reliable service. Specify that you're looking to avoid companies that operate call centres from distant cities like Sydney or Melbourne.

      2. **Business Tenure and Team Size**: Inquire about how long they have been in business and the size of their team. This gives an indication of their experience and capacity to handle your pest control needs effectively.

      3. **Google Reviews**: Check their Google Reviews to gauge their reputation and customer satisfaction levels. Pay attention to both positive and negative reviews for a balanced understanding of their service quality.

      4. **Queensland Health Timber Pest License**: Confirm if they hold a Queensland Health Timber Pest license. This is a crucial qualification for any pest control service, ensuring they are trained and authorized to handle timber pest issues.

      5. **QBCC Licensing**: Ask if they are licensed under the Queensland Building and Construction Commission (QBCC). This license is an additional assurance of their professionalism and adherence to industry standards.


      Remember, it's important to choose a pest control service that is not only qualified but also understands the specific challenges and conditions in the Gold Coast area. These questions will help you identify a service provider that meets these criteria.
