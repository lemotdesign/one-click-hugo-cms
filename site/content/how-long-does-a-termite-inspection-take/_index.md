      Make sure to get your home checked for termites at least **once a year**,
      following the Australian Standards 3660.2.


      **Consider more often**

      If your house is older, built a certain way, or close to woods, you might need more frequent inspections.


      **Current chemical treatment?**

      Without a chemical barrier around your home, termites can sneak in easily. Regular inspections are key for early detection and prevention, just like regular dental check-ups, especially if you don't have any termite treatment.
