      Here at Conquer Termites, we schedule **two hours** to conduct an annual
      termite inspection. 


      Time can vary due to the size and difficulty of the house or if we have discovered live termites. Then it will be a proposition of "the time it takes".


      #### How often should I get a Termite Inspection done?


      Make sure to get your home checked for termites at least **once a year**, following the Australian Standards 3660.2.


      **Consider more often**

      If your house is older, built a certain way, or close to woods, you might need more frequent inspections.


      **Current chemical treatment?**

      Without a chemical barrier around your home, termites can sneak in easily. Regular inspections are key for early detection and prevention, just like regular dental check-ups, especially if you don't have any termite treatment.
