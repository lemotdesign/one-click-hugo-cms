      Discovering termites in your home can be daunting, and you might be asking
      yourself – who do I contact and how much will it set me back?


      ### **Termite Inspection Cost on the Gold Coast**


      A **good** quality termite inspection in Brisbane for an average-sized house typically costs around **$330**.


      ### **Price Matters:**


      If you're not well-acquainted with termites or have never worked with a pest control expert before, it is likely your first question will be "How much"? However, it's crucial to ensure you’re comparing similar services when picking a company for your termite inspection. The sad reality is that the standard of service can vary widely and this is normally reflected in price.

      **This should include the following:**


      * The Inspector should be fully licensed, insured and have a QBCC license

      * Utilization of devices such as thermal cameras, moisture meters, and termatrac motion detectors.

      * Examination of the garden, fenceline, perimeter of the house, subfloor, internal exposed timbers, and the roof cavity.

      * A digital report delivered on the same day, alongside a treatment proposal.

      * An inspection duration ranges between one (minimum) to two hours.

      * #### **Fake companies - no QBCC license**


      Some companies might give the impression of being local, but they might operate from distant interstate call centres without the requisite Queensland licenses.


      For legitimate operation in Queensland, companies must possess a [QBCC license](https://www.qbcc.qld.gov.au/). Without it, these are essentially **subcontractors** who might not have proper insurance and shouldn't advertise termite-related services.


      * ### Free check offers - but not licensed


      Some entities lure customers with a "free termite check" but then propose dubious and overpriced baiting systems. Often, these operators lack appropriate licensing and might ask you to sign waivers, sidestepping Australian Standards.
