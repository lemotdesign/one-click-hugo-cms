      ### All You Need to Know:


      Discovering termites in your home can be daunting, and you might be asking yourself – who do I contact and how much will it set me back?


      ### **Price Matters:**


      If you're not well-acquainted with termites or have never worked with a pest control expert before, it is likely your first question will be "How much"? However, it's crucial to ensure you’re comparing similar services when picking a company for your termite inspection. The sad reality is that the standard of service can vary widely and this is normally reflected in price.


      ### **Termite Inspection Cost on the Gold Coast**


      A **good** quality termite inspection in Brisbane for an average-sized house typically costs around **$330**.


      **This should include the following:**


      * The Inspector should be fully licensed, insured and have a QBCC license

      * Utilization of devices such as thermal cameras, moisture meters, and termatrac motion detectors.

      * Examination of the garden, fenceline, perimeter of the house, subfloor, internal exposed timbers, and the roof cavity.

      * A digital report delivered on the same day, alongside a treatment proposal.

      * An inspection duration ranges between one (minimum) to two hours.

      ### Consumer Warning about Termite Inspections


      * #### **Fake companies - no QBCC license**


      Some companies might give the impression of being local, but they might operate from distant interstate call centres without the requisite Queensland licenses.


      ![Licenses for termite inspection on the Gold Coast](img/termite-licenses-queensland.png)


      For legitimate operation in Queensland, companies must possess a [QBCC license](https://www.qbcc.qld.gov.au/). Without it, these are essentially **subcontractors** who might not have proper insurance and shouldn't advertise termite-related services.


      * ### Free check offers - but not licensed


      Some entities lure customers with a "free termite check" but then propose dubious and overpriced baiting systems. Often, these operators lack appropriate licensing and might ask you to sign waivers, sidestepping Australian Standards.


      ### **Must-Ask Questions**


      To help you, we would like to give you a **checklist** of questions you should ask when calling companies in Brisbane, Australia. You don’t need to ask them all - choose your best three:


      * Do they have a Queensland Health Timber Pest **license**?

      * Does the company have a [QBCC](https://www.qbcc.qld.gov.au/node/2526) (Queensland Building Construction Commission) **license**?

      * Is the company **insurance,** and how much does it cover?

      * Do all the technicians carry and use **Thermal Cameras and Termatrac** Motion Detection devices?

      * Do they inspect the roof and all of the subfloor (space under the floor)?

      * How many hours do they assign to do a termite inspection?

      * Do I get a **digital report** on the day?

      * Can they supply a **treatment proposal** and do the work?

      * Are they **accredited** through the chemical company to apply the product?

      * Where is their office located?

      * How long has the business been operating and is it family-owned?
