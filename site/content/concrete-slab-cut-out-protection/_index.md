      Whenever a hole or cut-out is made in an existing concrete slab,
      especially for modifications such as repositioning plumbing, it becomes a
      potential entry point for termites. 


      Ensuring protection at this stage is essential not only for the integrity of your property but also to comply with regulations and achieve proper termite certification.


      ### The Two-Visit - Four-Step Process


      Ensuring a cut-out in a concrete slab is comprehensively protected from termites involves a multi-step approach.

      will fit sheeting collars around all plumbing pipes, electrical conduits,
      and other service channels. These collars serve as a preliminary shield

      address the 'Cold Joins' â€“ the gaps existing between the old slab and the
      new concrete pour. The process starts with the application of a primer to
      ensure the Protectacote adheres firmly and effectively."
