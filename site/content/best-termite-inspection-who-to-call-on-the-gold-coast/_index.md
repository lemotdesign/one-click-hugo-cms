      Discovering potential termite presence in your home can be deeply
      unnerving. As intimidating as it may be, choosing a trustworthy Gold Coast
      Pest Company shouldn't add to your worries.


      Your primary concern? *"Can I place my **trust** in them and will I receive genuine advice?"* Being unfamiliar with termites can leave you unsure about the right questions to pose and factors to weigh.


      Price might seem like the easiest parameter to rely on, but there's so much more to consider.

      To assist you, here's a **checklist** of crucial questions to pose when
      reaching out to Gold Coast-based companies.


      **Pick at least three that resonate most with you:**


      1. Is the company genuinely local to the Gold Coast? (Avoid call centres from Sydney or Melbourne).

      2. What's their business tenure and team size?

      3. How do their Google Reviews fare?

      4. Do they hold a Queensland Health Timber Pest **license**?

      5. Are they licensed under the [QBCC](https://www.qbcc.qld.gov.au/node/2526) (Queensland Building Construction Commission)?

      * Is the company **insured**, and to what extent?

      * Do all technicians utilize **[Thermal Cameras and Termatrac](https://www.conquertermites.com.au/inspections/termite-inspections/detection-devices/)** Motion Detection tools?

      * Does the inspection cover getting into the roof and the subfloor areas?

      * What's the duration of a typical termite inspection?

      * Will I receive a **digital report** on the same day?

      * Can they offer a **treatment proposal** and execute it?

      * Do they possess **accreditations** from the chemical manufacturers they use?


      The initial phone interaction and the level of assistance can be as telling as the aforementioned factors.

      * **Imitations**: Beware of companies lacking a [QBCC
      license](https://www.qbcc.qld.gov.au/). Many may seem local online but are
      operated from distant call centres. In Queensland, possessing a QBCC
      license is non-negotiable. Without it, they can't be insured and shouldn't
      advertise termite-related services.


      * **Misleading Free Offers**: Some might tempt you with a "free termite check," pushing for an overpriced baiting system. They aren't qualified, and you'd typically have to sign a waiver, indicating it's just a 'check', not a comprehensive inspection.

      The question of **"How much?"** is inevitable. With limited knowledge
      about termites, it's crucial to ensure you're comparing similar offerings.
      Unfortunately, there's a vast difference in proficiency and approach
      across the sector.


      On the Gold Coast, a standard termite inspection for an average-sized house ranges from **$280 to $330**.
