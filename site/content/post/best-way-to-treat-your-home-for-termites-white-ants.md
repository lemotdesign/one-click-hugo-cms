## Choosing the Right Termite Treatment for Your Home

Selecting the best termite treatment isn't a straightforward task; there's no one-size-fits-all solution. A tailored treatment plan is essential, taking into account several key factors:

* **Species and Colony Size**: Different termite species have varied behaviours and threats. Knowing the species and understanding the size of the colony is fundamental in determining treatment.
* **Extent of the Infestation**: A localized problem may require a different strategy compared to a widespread infestation.
* **Termite Entry Points**: Identifying how and where termites are entering your home can help target the treatment effectively.
* **Home Construction and Foundation Type**: Different building materials and foundation types can influence which treatment methods are most appropriate.
* **Surrounding Landscaping**: Trees, plants, and other landscaping elements around your property can impact termite behaviour and treatment choices.
* **Budget Considerations**: Naturally, cost is a significant factor for most homeowners. Finding a balance between effectiveness and affordability is crucial.

You don't need to understand these variables, but the Termite Technician you engage certainly does!

## Types of Termite Treatments on the Gold Coast 

1. **Chemical Soil Treatment - Barriers**: This is a common and effective treatment method on the Gold Coast. A liquid chemical is applied to the soil around and under a structure. Termites that pass through the treated soil are either repelled or killed.
2. **Termite Baiting Systems**: These are plastic stations filled with bait rods, cellulose material that's treated with a slow-acting growth inhibitor agent. Termites consume the bait and share it with their colony, eventually killing the colony over time.
3. **Physical Barriers**: These aren't designed to kill termites but rather deter them from entering the structure. These can include metal or crushed rock barriers, or specially-designed fabrics that are typically installed when a house is being built.

### Check List for Your Termite Professional:

When engaging a true termite profession, they should be jumping through all of these hoops:

1. **Termite Inspection:** A requirement of our insurance, QBBC and the Australian Standards, an inspection needs to be done prior to any treatment.
2. **Licensing**: Possession of a Queensland Health Timber Pest license is mandatory, signifying their authorization to manage termite issues in the area.
3. **Insurance**: It's crucial they carry industry-specific insurance, safeguarding both you and them against potential unforeseen complications.
4. **Building License**: For treatments that cost more than $1300, a valid QBCC (Queensland Building Construction Commission) license is imperative.
5. **Chemical Accreditation**: The professional should be a certified applicator of the chemical they recommend, an endorsement given by the manufacturer.
6. Have a company **Safety Plan** and appropriate PPE

Ensuring your chosen professional ticks these boxes guarantees a competent, trustworthy, and effective service.
