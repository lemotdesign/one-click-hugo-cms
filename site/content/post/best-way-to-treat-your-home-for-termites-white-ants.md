## Start with Choosing the Best Termite Treatment Company

Selecting the best termite treatment isn't a straightforward task; there's no one-size-fits-all solution. A tailored treatment plan is essential, taking into account several key factors:

#### What the 'Best' Treatment Company needs to consider

Before recommending a termite treatment these are the factors that need to be considered:

* **Species and Colony Size**: Different termite species have varied behaviours and threats. Knowing the species and understanding the size of the colony is fundamental in determining treatment.
* **Extent of the Infestation**: A localized problem may require a different strategy compared to a widespread infestation.
* **Termite Entry Points**: Identifying how and where termites are entering your home can help target the treatment effectively.
* **Home Construction and Foundation Type**: Different building materials and foundation types can influence which treatment methods are most appropriate.
* **Surrounding Landscaping**: Trees, plants, and other landscaping elements around your property can impact termite behaviour and treatment choices.

You don't need to understand these variables, but the Termite Technician you engage certainly does!

### Check List - To Choose the Right Pest Company:

When you're working with a bona fide termite expert, you should expect the following standard of service:

1. **Termite Inspection:** A requirement of our insurance, QBBC and the Australian Standards, an inspection needs to be done before any treatment. 
2. **Detailed Treatment Proposal**: They must provide you with a written **Treatment Proposal**. This isn't just a simple quote; it should clearly itemize the specific areas of treatment, the chemicals they plan to use, and any potential limitations or considerations. This ensures transparency, letting you know precisely what to expect and helps in setting clear expectations for both parties.
3. **Licensing**: Possession of a Queensland Health Timber Pest license is mandatory, signifying their authorization to manage termite treatments.
4. **Insurance**:They must have industry-specific insurance, safeguarding both you and them against potential unforeseen complications.
5. **Termite Treatment License**: For treatments that cost more than $1300, a valid **QBCC** (Queensland Building Construction Commission) license is imperative.
6. **Chemical Accreditation**: The professional should be a certified applicator of the chemical they recommend, an endorsement given by the manufacturer.
7. **Safety First**: They should have a comprehensive company **Safety Plan** in place. Additionally, using appropriate Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) is vital to ensure the safety of your property, yourself, and the professionals at work. This demonstrates their commitment to health and security protocols, reducing potential risks during treatment procedures.
8. **Budget Considerations**: Naturally, cost is a significant factor for most homeowners. Finding a balance between effectiveness and affordability is crucial.

Ensuring your chosen professional ticks these boxes guarantees a competent, trustworthy, and effective service.

## Types of Termite Treatments on the Gold Coast

1. **Chemical Soil Treatment - Barriers**: This is a common and effective treatment method on the Gold Coast. A liquid chemical is applied to the soil around and under a structure. Termites that pass through the treated soil are either repelled or killed.
2. **Termite Baiting Systems**: These are plastic stations filled with bait rods, cellulose material that's treated with a slow-acting growth inhibitor agent. Termites consume the bait and share it with their colony, eventually killing the colony over time.
3. **Physical Barriers**: These aren't designed to kill termites but rather deter them from entering the structure. These can include metal or crushed rock barriers, or specially-designed fabrics that are typically installed when a house is being built.
