## The Cost of Termite Inspection on the Gold Coast: All You Need to Know

Discovering termites in your home can be daunting, and you might be asking yourself – who do I contact and how much will it set me back?

### **Price Matters:**

If you're not well-acquainted with termites or have never worked with a pest control expert before, it is likely your first question will be "How much"? However, it's crucial to ensure you’re comparing similar services when picking a company for your termite inspection. The sad reality is that the standard of service can vary widely and this is reflected in price.

### **Termite Inspection Cost on the Gold Coast**

A good quality termite inspection in Brisbane for an average-sized house typically costs around **$330**.

**This should include the following:**

* Utilization of devices such as thermal cameras, moisture meters, and termatrac motion detectors.
* Examination of the garden, fenceline, perimeter of the house, subfloor, internal exposed timbers, and the roof cavity.
* A digital report delivered on the same day, alongside a treatment proposal.
* An inspection duration ranges between one (minimum) to two hours.

### Consumer Warning about termite inspections

* #### **Fake companies - no QBCC license**

es might give the impression of being local, but they might operate from distant call centres without the requisite Queensland licenses.![](https://www.conquertermites.com.au/images/uploads/qbcc-license-cards.jpg)

For legitimate operation in Queensland, companies must possess a [QBCC license](https://www.qbcc.qld.gov.au/). Without it, these are essentially **subcontractors** who might not have proper insurance and shouldn't advertise termite-related services.

### Free check offers - not licensed

Some entities lure customers with a "free termite check" but then propose dubious and overpriced baiting systems. Often, these operators lack appropriate licensing and might ask you to sign waivers, sidestepping Australian Standards.

### **Must-Ask Questions**

* Is the company **insurance,** and how much does it cover?
* Do all the technicians carry and use **[Thermal Cameras & Termatrac](https://www.conquertermites.com.au/inspections/termite-inspections/detection-devices/)** Motion Detection devices?
* Do they inspect the roof and all of the subfloor (space under the floor)?
* How many hours do they assign to do a termite inspection?
