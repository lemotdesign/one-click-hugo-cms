  The difference between termites & white ants - NOTHING!

  In Australia, calling Termites, White Ants, is saying the same thing. Technically, termites are in the cockroach family (Sub-order of the Blattodea order), and ants are in the wasp family (Order Hymenoptera). Termites' bodies aren’t segmented, whereas ants are.
