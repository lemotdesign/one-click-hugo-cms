  The difference between termites & white ants - NOTHING!

  In Australia, calling Termites, White Ants, is saying the same thing. Technically, termites are in the cockroach family (Sub-order of the Blattodea order), and ants are in the wasp family (Order Hymenoptera). Termites' bodies arenâ€™t segmented, whereas ants are.

Contrary to popular belief, termites, colloquially known as "White Ants" in Australia, aren't ants at all. The similarity in appearance between Black Ants and Termites can lead to this confusion. Both species have six legs, antennas, and live in colonies. Yet, they differ in many ways, from body shape to behaviour.
