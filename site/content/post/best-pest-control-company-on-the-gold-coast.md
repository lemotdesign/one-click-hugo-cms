### How to pick a company to do your termite treatment?

Determining the best termite treatment company on the Gold Coast is subjective as it depends on individual needs and preferences.

### Five Points to consider when choosing a Pest Control Company

1. **Reputation**: Look for a company with a good reputation and positive customer reviews.
2. **Experience**: Choose a company with experience in treating termites specifically.
3. **Licensing and insurance**: Make sure the company is licensed and insured to perform termite treatment services.
4. **Methods**: Consider the company’s approach to termite treatment, including their use of chemicals, baits, and physical barriers.
5. **Customer service**: Look for a company that provides excellent customer service and is responsive to your needs.

### Before the termite treatment

1. You need to get a **[Termite Inspection](https://www.conquertermites.com.au/inspections/)** done before the treatment, as stipulated in the Australian Standards, and to comply with insurance requirements. If someone is not suggesting this, then you should worry.
2. You should receive a **Treatment Proposal** that clearly outlines the cost, type of approach, plus limitations.

### Types of Termite Management Systems

* **[Chemical treatments](https://www.conquertermites.com.au/termite-control/treating-a-house/chemical-treatments/)** (barriers) are Queensland's most common termite treatment.

Check our [Recommended Chemicals](https://www.conquertermites.com.au/termite-control/treating-a-house/recommended-chemicals/) page for more information.

* **[Baiting systems](https://www.conquertermites.com.au/termite-control/baiting-programs/)**: Baiting systems are another option for protecting homes on the Gold Coast. There is an additional ongoing cost to monitor the stations annually.

### How to choose a company to do your termite treatment

Homeowners should carefully consider their options and choose the best treatment for their property to protect it from the damage caused by termites.

But it would be best if you compare apples with apples when selecting a company for your termite treatment. Sadly, our industry significantly differs in quality, knowledge, approach, and honesty.

#### How a termite treatment should be done

### Consumer Warning

* #### **Fake companies - no QBCC license**

Many pest control companies construct a website to make them look local but have their call centre in another city and don’t have the appropriate Queensland licenses.

All companies operating in Queensland need a QBCC license to do termite treatments. If they don’t have a QBCC license, they can’t get insurance and shouldn’t be advertising they do termite treatments. Otherwise, you are engaging a subcontractor.

* #### Free check offers - not licensed.

Some companies offer a free “termite check” and quickly suggest a dodgy, overpriced wooden box baiting system as a treatment. These guys aren’t licensed or qualified. Often you need to sign a waiver to say you are accepting a ‘check’, not an inspection to the Australian Standards.

### **Questions you should ask before engaging a company to do a termite treatment**

#### **Checklist:**

To help you, we would like to give you a **checklist** of questions you should ask when calling companies on the Gold Coast. You don’t need to ask them all - choose your best three:

* Do you have a Queensland Health Timber Pest **license**?
* Does your company have a [QBCC](https://www.qbcc.qld.gov.au/node/2526) (Queensland Building Construction Commission) **license**?
* Is your company **insurance,** and how much does it cover?
* Can you supply a **treatment proposal** and do the work?
* Can you offer options - chemical or baiting programs
* Do you use generic brands or proven legitimate brands?
* Are they **accredited** through the chemical company to apply the product?
* How long has the business been operating, and is it family-owned?
