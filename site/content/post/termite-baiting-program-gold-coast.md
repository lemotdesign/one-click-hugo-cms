* Is Trelona effective?

  Trelona is a highly-effective advance termite bait system to control subterranean termite colonies. The unique Trelona bait stations have been designed to encourage termite interception and quick feeding that effectively controls pests. 
* How long does Trelona last?

  Trelona ATBS is a highly-effective, long-lasting baiting system that, when used in combination with other Termidor products, includes bait cartridges that can last for 5 years in Australian conditions. 

  Trelona baiting stations can be installed by an accredited Trelona ATBS pest professional who will identify the correct amount of time required between inspection periods, which may vary from one- to six-month intervals depending on the level of termite activity, site risks and the type of system installed. 
* What is the active ingredient in Trelona?

  The active ingredient of Trelona ATBS is Novaluron. This powerful and innovative active ingredient means that Trelona requires significantly less bait for complete colony elimination of termites when compared to other termite baits.

What is better Trelona vs. Sentricon?

Trelona ATBS has some considerable advantages when compared to other products on the market. The Trelona ATBS system has 50 per cent more available bait per application and it is the only system to have a label use in conjunction with the Termidor range. 

Accredited Termidor pest specialists can use products such as Trelona Advance Termite Bait System for ongoing management and control of termites, in combination with products such as Termidor Residual or Termidor HE. Termidor is a highly-effective termite treatment that has been a trusted household product for over 20 years.
