## What is the Best Termite Baiting Options on the Gold Coast?

Choosing the perfect termite baiting system isn't just about picking any option off the shelf. It's about finding a system that truly works!

While it might sound like we're stating the obvious, it's essential to realize that not all baiting systems are made equal. Differences abound when it comes to effectiveness, durability, and pricing, especially here on the Gold Coast.

### Key Factors to Ponder When Selecting a Termite Baiting System:

1. **Flexibility**: Can you monitor the system yourself, or are you tied into a dedicated monitoring service?
2. **Bait Appeal**: Is the bait (cellulose material) genuinely enticing to termites? Remember, if they're not attracted to it, they won't consume it.
3. **Effectiveness of Active Ingredient**: Is it potent enough to eradicate a colony? How soon can you expect results?
4. **Durability and Accessibility**: Are the in-ground stations tough and user-friendly? If you have pets or frequent lawn activities, you'll need a resilient station.
5. **Budget Considerations**: What's the initial installation cost? How much does a year-long monitoring service set you back? What about the expenses tied to replacing consumed bait capsules?
