## What do Termites - White Ants look like in Australia?



Termites are indeed fascinating creatures, often hidden from sight. They are small, soft-bodied insects that live in large colonies. Their appearance can vary slightly depending on their role within the colony. There are three main types of termites in a colony: workers, soldiers, and reproductive individuals.

1. **Worker Termites**: These are the most numerous and are responsible for feeding the colony, building and repairing the nest, and taking care of the young. They are typically about 1/4 to 1/2 inch long, cream-colored, and have no wings.
2. **Soldier Termites**: Soldiers defend the colony against predators like ants. They are similar in size to workers but can be distinguished by their larger, darker heads and strong mandibles (jaws).
3. **Reproductive Termites**: These include the king, queen, and alates (winged termites). The queen is much larger than the other termites and can live for several years, laying thousands of eggs. Alates are the ones you might see during certain times of the year when they swarm to start new colonies.
