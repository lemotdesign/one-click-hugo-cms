  CSIRO did a survey to map where termites were most active in Australia. Guess
  what, Gold Coast is bang in the middle of 'High Termite Activity'

  Termites can be foraging in any suburb on the Gold Coast at any time!

### Gold Coast homes are very vulnerable to Termite Attack

A question many homeowners ask our technicians; “Is the Gold Coast a bad area for termites”? Meaning, is their home located in an area where they are more susceptible to a termite attack. To answer that question you need to consider the macro and micro environmental factors that influence termites.

On a **macro level**, Gold Coast is located in a **high-risk** area, as illustrated by the CISRO map supplied below. Homes in these areas are at higher risk of being attacked by termites due to the high mean temperature experienced through winter and high rainfalls. Nests need to be maintained at a temperature between 25°C - 36°C. (Australian Museum). Basically, the cooler it gets, fewer the termites. That is why Tasmania and New Zealand are termite-free.

On a **Micro level**, (these are the factors you can see and deal with around your home). You can actually influence the outcome of your home being, or not being, attacked by termites. For example:

* Large native trees (Gum Trees) - are a favourite nesting place for termites 
* Moisture in the ground near the house - provides conducive conditions for the termites - that leaking shower or tap
* Construction of the house - structural timbers might be in direct contact with the soil allowing direct entry.
* Tree stumps, wooden retaining walls and loose timbers on the ground allow a higher population of termites to survive near your home.
* Current chemical treatment - this is the biggest positive or negative factor in preventing termites from attacking your home.
