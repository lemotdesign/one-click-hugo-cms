## Is Pest Control Safe for Pets and Humans?

### Children or pets, is it safe?

Got kiddos or furry friends? No worries! We always adjust our methods based on your home's unique needs, to only apply the safest product available in Australia.

We will be applying a mix of treatments like gel bait, dust, and surface sprays. All products we apply meet the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority guidelines. Safety first, always!

Before we dive into the nitty-gritty of our general pest control, we wanted to give you a heads-up on what to expect and how to prepare. 

### What are we treating?

Our general pest control package covers cockroaches, spiders, black ants and silverfish. 

If you have an issue with pests such as fleas, pantry moths, rodents or any other annoying pest, these will require a special and separate treatment.

### How long does it take?

The treatment will be straightforward, usually wrapping up in about 1 to 1.5 hours.

### Do I need to stay away?

Where possible we ask that you go outside while we spray inside and stay inside while we spray the outside. You should keep all people and pets away from treated areas until dry. 

Re-entry is fine after a short time and our technician will let you know when it is okay to do so.

### How long will the treatment last?

We back our treatment with a 12-month call-back warranty for cockroaches & silverfish.       3 months for ants, and 6 months for webbing spiders. 
Just a small note, if your place is a commercial premise or if we're dealing with rodents, fleas or other nuisance pests, the treatment and warranty work a tad differently.

### Talk to us

Let us know what is really 'bugging' you. That way, we can really target our treatment to get the best outcomes for you. 

Also, please let our technician know if you have any allergies or have particular areas that you don’t want to be treated.

### General Information about our Pest Control Treatment:

1. The idea of ‘Pest Control’ is about reducing the pesty pests’ population to near zero. It is not about applying a nasty product to keep all insects away for 12 months. Insects will recolonise your home naturally over time.
2. There is a residual action with the treatment, so it might take several weeks to be fully effective. In the case where the pest population or conditions are severe, we might recommend more frequent treatments.\

## What to do before we come:

1. Vacuum along the skirting boards and wet clean all hard floors (tiles, timber floors and laminate planks). The reason is that we don’t want you to ‘wet wipe’ the edges of the hard floors for at least four weeks where we have sprayed our product. 
   The longer you can leave it there, the better it will work. You can vacuum or sweep.  
2. Remove sensitive items like kids’ toys from the floor. and move items away from the walls. This way, we will be able to achieve the maximum application throughout your home. 
3. You don’t need to empty cupboards or move heavy furniture as we will be applying gel bait in these areas.
4. Our technician will always do a pre-service check, we are happy to move pet bowls, dog beds etc. But bird cages or fish tanks should be covered before we start.
5. Remove clothes from the line.
6. If you are planning to get your house washed or carpet cleaned, do it before we come. 
7. Don’t remove spiderwebs before we come. We need the spiders to climb over their webs for the product to work.
8. To reduce black ants, keep gardens away from the external walls and cut back any tree branches that are touching the house.
