## Best Termite Treatment for a Cut-out in a concrete slab

Whenever a hole or cut-out is made in an existing concrete slab, especially for modifications such as repositioning plumbing, it becomes a potential entry point for termites. 

Ensuring protection at this stage is essential not only for the integrity of your property but also to comply with regulations and achieve proper termite certification.

### The Two Step Protection

#### 1. Penetration Collars

Prior to poring the concrete, we need to come out and slip on the sheeting collars to all plumbing pipes, electrical and service conduits.

#### 2. Protectacoate Primer

Once the concrete has been poured and cured, we come out again to apply a parging application to the 'Cold Joins' (gap between the existing slab and the new concrete). This requires four applications of product:

Initially, we need to apply a primer application so the Protectacote adheres properly

#### 3. Fibreglass Strengthening Strips

To ensure the join is securely bonded and that there will be no cracking, we apply a 10 cm fibreglass strip to bond with the parging application

#### 4. Homeguard Protectacote Parging

Then we liberely apply the FMC Protectacote parging application. The product has an active ingredient called Bifenthrin, which is a strong repellent for termites. The product is so strong, the manufacturer FMC has given in a 5o year life span!
