## Best Termite Treatment for a Cut-out in a Concrete Slab

Whenever a hole or cut-out is made in an existing concrete slab, especially for modifications such as repositioning plumbing, it becomes a potential entry point for termites. 

Ensuring protection at this stage is essential not only for the integrity of your property but also to comply with regulations and achieve proper termite certification.

### The Two-Visit - Four-Step Process

Ensuring a cut-out in a concrete slab is comprehensively protected from termites involves a multi-step approach. Here's a breakdown of our two-visit, four-step process:

#### 1. Penetration Collars

**First Visit:** Before the fresh concrete is poured, our expert team will fit sheeting collars around all plumbing pipes, electrical conduits, and other service channels. These collars serve as a preliminary shield against termites.

#### 2. Protectacoate Primer Application

**Second Visit:** After the concrete has set, our technicians return to address the 'Cold Joins' â€“ the gaps existing between the old slab and the new concrete pour. The process starts with the application of a primer to ensure the Protectacote adheres firmly and effectively.

#### 3. Fiberglass Strengthening Strips

To guarantee the integrity of the joint and prevent potential cracking, we overlay a 10 cm wide fibreglass strip. This strip bonds with the parging application, ensuring a fortified and lasting barrier.

#### 4. Homeguard Protectacote Parging Application

The final layer is the FMC Protectacote parging application. This product is enriched with Bifenthrin, a potent termite repellent. Its efficacy is underscored by the manufacturer, FMC, who vouches for its durability with a 50-year lifespan!

It might take several applications to get the 8 mm thickness.

## Pricing for Termite Protection of a Concrete Slab Cut-out

In the Gold Coast region, our pricing structure for safeguarding a standard cut-out in your concrete slab against termites starts at **$495**. This cost encapsulates:

* Two scheduled visits to your property.
* Provision of requisite documentation, notably **Form 43** and the Certificate of Installation.

For larger cut-outs or those with more than three penetrations, additional costs may be incurred due to the extra work and materials required. 

**Send a photo:** To give you a more precise estimate, it would be advantageous for us to view a photo of the cut-out area. This visual reference can help us ascertain the extent of the work needed and thus offer a more accurate quote.

**Cancellation Policy:** We understand that sometimes plans change. However, please note that if a cancellation is made within 24 hours of the scheduled appointment, a fee of $250 will be levied to cover our pre-arranged commitments and preparations.
