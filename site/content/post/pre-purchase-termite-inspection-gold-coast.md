It's a big scary decision to purchase your dream home. You want to know that you're not buying a horror story that has hollow walls and a crumbling roof. 

#### You really should get a Termite Expert that knows what to look for. 

In our industry, we really take the Pre-purchase Termite Inspection seriously. In fact, there is a separate Australian Standard dedicated to it, AS 4349.3.2010: Timber Pest Inspection.

But to be honest with you, the Pre-purchase Timber Pest Inspection causes the most litigation. This can be a result of the inspector's incompetency (missed something oblivious or didn't give the right recommendations and advice). But a lot of times it is a buyer thinking they can get easy monies from the inspection company's insurer.  

### Things to Know about a Pre-purchase Inspection:

* It is only a **visual inspection** of areas that are exposed. As of yet, inspectors cannot see through walls and behind built-in cabinetry. 
* The scope of the inspection includes Subterranean Termites, Borer activity and Fugal Decay. It does not involve the inspection of Drywood Termites (Family: KALOTERMITIDAE)
* There are a lot of **limitations**. In fact, we are duty-bound to send you a "Timber Pest Inspection Agreement" form that you need to read and acknowledge prior to the inspection. 





### Limitations on Timber Pest Inspections



### All Termite Inspections are Visual Only

##### The Termite Inspector cannot see through walls 

So a big frustration for Home Buyers is getting a report recommending an "Invasive" inspection



Please find the Pre-purchase approval form for the Timber Pest inspection attached above. As a legitimately insured company, we are required to inform you of the scope and limitation of a pre-purchase timber pest inspection prior to the inspection. This is a standard form used in our industry.
