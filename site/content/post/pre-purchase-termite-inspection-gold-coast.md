It's a big scary decision to purchase your dream home. You want to know that you're not buying a horror story that has hollow walls and a crumbling roof. 

#### You really should get a Termite Expert that knows what to look for.

In our industry, we really take the Pre-purchase Termite Inspection seriously. In fact, there is a separate Australian Standard dedicated to it, AS 4349.3.2010: Timber Pest Inspection.

But to be honest with you, the Pre-purchase Timber Pest Inspection causes the most litigation. This can be a result of the inspector's incompetency (missed something oblivious or didn't give the right recommendations and advice). But a lot of times it is a buyer thinking they can get easy monies from the inspection company's insurer.  

The purpose of the inspection is to provide advice about the condition of the property concerning timber pest activity.

### Things to Know about a Pre-purchase Inspection:

* It is only a **visual inspection** of areas that are exposed. As of yet, inspectors cannot see through walls and behind built-in cabinetry. 
* The scope of the inspection includes Subterranean Termites, Borer activity and Fugal Decay. It does not involve the inspection of Drywood Termites (Family: KALOTERMITIDAE)
* There are a lot of **limitations**. In fact, we are duty-bound to send you a "Timber Pest Inspection Agreement" form that you need to read and acknowledge prior to the inspection. This might seem like an opt-out, but really we are trying to set expectations. 
* The inspection **WILL NOT** involve any **invasive** inspection. this includes cutting, breaking apart, dismantling, removing or moving objects including, but not limited to, roofing, wall and ceiling sheeting, ducting, foliage, mouldings, debris, roof insulation, sarking, sisalation, floor or wall coverings, sidings, fixtures, floors, pavers, furnishings, appliances or personal possessions.

*We get so many calls from Home Buyers on the Gold Coast who have had a Pre-purchase Inspection Report done that have a recommendation for an invasive inspection. Have a read below about what you need to do or organise.*

* There should be clear advice about the status of the **Termite Management System**. Is it current or is it suitable? If there is no evidence of a current Termite Treatment in place, then the inspector is duty-bound to rate the structure at HIGH risk of a termite infestation. (*Advice: You should negotiate the cost to install a chemical treatment prior to settlement).

The main reason homes get termites on the Gold Coast is that there is not the appropriate protection in place. It's not the area, season or construction type (maybe a little of this), but that there was no system stopping the termites.

### Invasive Inspection for Termites

A big frustration for Home Buyers is getting a report recommending an "Invasive" inspection. The problem is that it's not your home to pull things away or cut access points to check. And then there's the question; is it really necessary?

Normally, an inspector will suggest this invasive approach only when there's a strong suspicion of termite activity in a particular area. It shouldn’t be a generalized recommendation to absolve them of accountability. Instead, it should be grounded in specific observations.

In many cases, termite damage could be lurking just beyond view, behind wall linings. Without direct visual access, it’s almost impossible to determine the severity of this damage.

#### The Two Dilemmas  

1. The potential cost and aftermath of removing wall linings or fixtures might exceed the actual costs of termite repair.
2. You could be buying a house with extensive hidden termite damage if you don't check.

#### The Solution:

1. Start with a time-honored technique: gently knock on the wall. Listening for the tell-tale signs of crumbling termite residue can provide initial insights.
2. Strategically insert a Borecsope' to check inside the wall cavities that doesn't cause significant damage.
3. Use a Termatrac Motion Detection Device to confirm the presence of live termites.
