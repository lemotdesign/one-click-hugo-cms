### Termite Treatment Maintenance: How Often and Why?

Many residents in the Gold Coast often wonder about the necessity of topping up their termite treatments and how frequently it should be done. We're here to shed some light on this important topic.

**Here are some crucial facts to keep in mind:**

1. **Termites Are A Constant Threat**: It's a fact that all gardens on the Gold Coast have termites foraging from multiple nests nearby or on your property.
2. **Vulnerable Homes**: Without a current and suitable termite management system in place, your house is at risk of termite infestations.

### **Frequency of Termite Treatments**

The frequency of replenishing your termite treatment depends on the manufacturer's recommendations for the specific chemical used. Following the manufacturer's guidelines ensures the chemical protection lasts as indicated on the label.

#### **Non-Repellent Transfer Products**

* Termidor: Recommended every 8 years
* Altriset: Recommended every 6 years
* Premise: Recommended every 5 years

#### **Repellent Product**

* Bilfex: Typically between 5 to 10 years, depending on the application ratio

### **Beware of Misleading Information**

Some homeowners have reported being advised by pest control companies to conduct annual top-ups of their termite treatment. This is not only misleading but also unfair to homeowners. No chemical on the market requires replenishment every 12 months. If they are recommending that, they are doggy, please avoid! 

### **Finding Trustworthy Guidance**

It's essential to ensure your termite technician is transparent and trustworthy. Unfortunately, some individuals in our industry may not be well-informed or might deliberately mislead you.

### **How to Verify**

If you're uncertain, request to see the application instructions on the chemical bottle (usually under the label). Pest controllers are obligated to follow the manufacturer's instructions and application ratios. Additionally, you can contact the manufacturer directly for clarification:

* Premise ENVU (formerly Bayer): [Premise ENVU](https://www.au.envu.com/pest-management/products/premisesc200)
* Altriset SYNGENTA: [Altriset SYNGENTA](https://www.syngentappm.com.au/altriset-termiticide)

### **Proper Termite Treatment Procedure**

The wisest decision a homeowner can make to safeguard their home from foraging termites is to maintain a current chemical treatment. But how long does such a treatment last, and when should it be replenished?

Every registered termiticide in Australia comes with a "recommended lifespan" determined by the chemical manufacturer. This lifespan is established through rigorous field trials that align with guidelines from the APVMA (Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority) and Australian Standards 3660.1-2000 for new building work and 3660.2-2000 for existing buildings and structures.

It's important to note that the maximum recommended lifespan is under ideal conditions, including good soil quality, low surrounding termite pressure (away from bushland), and uncomplicated house construction. In less-than-ideal scenarios, the recommended chemical lifespan may need to be shorter.

### **Where to Find This Information**

Following a chemical treatment, the company is legally required to provide a **COI** (Certificate of Installation), a three-page document containing a treatment mud map, details of the applied chemical, and the treatment date. 

Additionally, there should be a **Durable Treatment Label** in the electrical meter box for your reference.
