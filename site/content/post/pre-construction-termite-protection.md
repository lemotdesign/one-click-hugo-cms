## Does your Builder have Your long term insterest?

It might come off as a tough query, but unfortunately, this reflects a genuine concern within the construction sector, especially when it pertains to adhering to top-notch termite protection standards for new constructions.

#### The Unsettling Truth of Termite Certification for Property Owners

Let's clarify: there are numerous dedicated and upright builders operating in the Gold Coast. However, a concerning trend we've observed is that a significant fraction are primarily looking to procure the 'Form 43' at the lowest possible price. For instance, while you may have been charged $3,000 for the installation of a termite management system, the actual cost might have been a mere $600. You don't need to be a math expert to see where the extra cash is funnelled!

It's wise to request a glimpse of the Termite Installer's invoice. This adds a layer of transparency and ensures you're getting what you've paid for.

### Working to the Minimum Requirements

See, the thing is, the minimum reqirement for certification under the Australian Building Code is to stop 'concealed' termite ingress. Then it is relienent on a continuous Visual Inspection Zone of 75 mm to detect any external ingress.

Majority of the 'New Builds' on the Gold Coast compromise this Visual Inspection Zone with paths, driveways and landscaping. If you walk around your new house and cannot see a continuous 75 mm of the slab edge, then it doesn't comply and a Form 43 **cannot** be issued. 

### Visual Inspection Zones - The Truth

Here's the crux: the Australian Building Code stipulates the baseline requirement for termite protection certification as halting 'concealed' termite entry. Following this, there's a reliance on a consistent Visual Inspection Zone spanning 75 mm to identify any external breaches.

A significant portion of 'New Builds' in the Gold Coast inadvertently or intentionally obscure this Visual Inspection Zone through the addition of pathways, driveways, and landscaping features. If you take a walk around your newly constructed property and are unable to spot a continuous 75 mm of the slab edge exposed, then it's not in compliance. Under these conditions, a Form 43 should **not** be legitimately issued.

#### Key Points for Visual Inspection Zone:

1. **Communication**: Did your Builder inform you about the periodic inspections necessary to ensure termite protection?
2. **Integrity of the Inspection Zone**: Evaluate whether the stipulated 75 mm visual inspection zone around the slab has been maintained. A quick way to assess this is by inspecting the edges of your driveway where it meets the house.
3. **Slab Edge Alterations**: The slab edge should remain free from renderings, tiles, claddings, or concealments via flashing. Painting is permissible, but any other treatment or alteration compromises the inspection zone.
4. **Additional Attachments**: Has any structure like a deck, patio, or cabinetry been added adjacent to the external perimeter, thereby obscuring the visual inspection zone?
5. **Termite Management System**: Is there an effective termite prevention system integrated either atop or at the base of the slab edge?

It's crucial to address these checkpoints to ensure that your property remains compliant with regulations and, more importantly, safe from potential termite invasions.
