## Does your Builder have Your long term insterest?

This might seem a harsh question, but this sadly is the reality in the building industry when it comes to complying with ensuring the best termite protection has been installed to a new construction.

#### The Scary Thing about Termite Certification for Homeowners

This is no a blanket statement, as there are many honest and reputable Builders on the Gold Coast. But we find a significant number just want to secure the 'Form 43' for the cheapest price. Now, they might have allocated and charge you $3,000 to have a termite management syetem installed, but got it done for only $600. Guess where the cut goes!

Ask to see the Termite Installer's invoice.

### Working to the Minimum Requirements

See, the thing is, the minimum reqirement for certification under the Australian Building Code is to stop 'concealed' termite ingress. Then it is relienent on a continuous Visual Inspection Zone of 75 mm to detect any external ingress.

Majority of the 'New Builds' on the Gold Coast compromise this Visual Inspection Zone with paths, driveways and landscaping. If you walk around your new house and cannot see a continuous 75 mm of the slab edge, then it doesn't comply and a Form 43 **cannot** be issued. 

### Visual Inspection Zones - The Truth

Just before you move into your new home, the Builder gives you the keys and a bundle of documents. The Builder tells you they have gotten 'XYZ' system installed to protect you from termites. You think it's all tickyboo and your home will be safe from termites.

If the Builder didn't tell you that you should walk around your home every 3 months to check the slab edge for termite mud leads, then you **aren't** maintaining the Visual Inspection Zone that they have signed off on. 

#### Visual Inspection Zone Check Points:

1. Did the Builder tell you about the reguarlar checking that needs to be done?
2. Has the exposed slab visual inspection zone of 75 mm been compromise. Easy, check your driveway edges where it abutts the house.  
3. The slab edge should not be rendered, tiled, clad or concealed by flashing. You can paint it, but thats all. 
4. Has an attachement (deck, patio or cabintery) been constructed up against the external perimeter concealing the visual inspection zone?
5. Is there a termite management system in place on top or at the base of the slab edge?
