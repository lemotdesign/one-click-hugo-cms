      When it comes to pest control, your safety and comfort are paramount. We
      arrange our treatment process to minimize disruption and maximize
      protection for you, your family, and your pets.


      **Here's what we recommend during treatment:**


      * **While Spraying Indoors:** We advise you to step outside. This allows the treatment to settle and dry to minimise exposure to the application process.

      * **While Treating Outdoors:** Conversely, it's best to remain indoors. This helps prevent any direct contact with the treatments and ensures the application is undisturbed.

      * **Post-Treatment:** We ask that you avoid the treated areas until they are completely dry. This drying period is crucial for the effectiveness of the treatment and your safety.


      **We will send you information for the best outcome**


      We will email you a "Pest Advice Notice" before the treatment so you know what to do before we come and what to do after the treatment
